# Invert Binary Tree

Inverting a binary tree is a classic tree manipulation algorithm that creates a mirror image of the original tree by swapping the left and right children of every node. This elegant transformation is both visually intuitive and algorithmically straightforward, making it a popular interview question and educational example.

## The Challenge

Given the root of a binary tree, invert the tree and return its root. The inversion process requires swapping the left and right children for every node in the tree, effectively creating a mirror image along the vertical axis.

### Example 1

```js
Input: root = [4,2,7,1,3,6,9]
Output: [4,7,2,9,6,3,1]
```

_Explanation: The original tree with root 4 has its left subtree (2,1,3) and right subtree (7,6,9) swapped, resulting in a mirrored structure._

### Example 2

```js
Input: root = [2,1,3]
Output: [2,3,1]
```

_Explanation: The simple tree with root 2 has its children 1 and 3 swapped in the output._

### Speed and Efficiency
</summary>

The binary tree inversion algorithm is remarkably efficient:

- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree. This is because each node in the tree must be visited exactly once.

- **Space Complexity**: 
  - O(h) for the recursive approach, where h is the height of the tree. This represents the maximum depth of the recursion stack.
  - In the worst case (a completely unbalanced tree), this becomes O(n).
  - For iterative approaches using a queue or stack, the space complexity is also O(n) in the worst case.

### Key Principles
</summary>

The inversion algorithm relies on several fundamental concepts:

- **Recursive Structure**: The problem naturally decomposes into smaller subproblems (inverting left and right subtrees).

- **Post-order Processing**: Typically implemented by first recursively inverting the subtrees, then swapping the children.

- **Tree Traversal**: Can be implemented using depth-first (recursive or with a stack) or breadth-first (with a queue) approaches.

- **In-place Modification**: The tree structure is modified directly without creating a new tree.

### Common Pitfalls
</summary>

When implementing the binary tree inversion algorithm, be mindful of these common challenges:

- **Null Handling**: Forgetting to check for null nodes can lead to null pointer exceptions.

- **Return Value Confusion**: Failing to return the root node after inversion, especially in recursive implementations.

- **Incomplete Traversal**: Not ensuring that all nodes in the tree are visited and processed.

- **Recursion Depth**: For very deep trees, recursive approaches may cause stack overflow errors.

### Implementation Approaches
</summary>

There are several ways to implement the binary tree inversion algorithm:

- **Recursive Approach**: The most intuitive method that follows the natural recursive structure of trees.
  ```python
  def invertTree(root):
      if not root:
          return None
      # Swap the children
      root.left, root.right = root.right, root.left
      # Recursively invert the subtrees
      invertTree(root.left)
      invertTree(root.right)
      return root
  ```

- **Iterative Approach with Queue (Level Order Traversal)**:
  ```python
  def invertTree(root):
      if not root:
          return None
      queue = [root]
      while queue:
          node = queue.pop(0)
          # Swap the children
          node.left, node.right = node.right, node.left
          # Add children to queue
          if node.left:
              queue.append(node.left)
          if node.right:
              queue.append(node.right)
      return root
  ```

- **Iterative Approach with Stack (Depth First Traversal)**:
  ```python
  def invertTree(root):
      if not root:
          return None
      stack = [root]
      while stack:
          node = stack.pop()
          # Swap the children
          node.left, node.right = node.right, node.left
          # Add children to stack
          if node.right:
              stack.append(node.right)
          if node.left:
              stack.append(node.left)
      return root
  ```

### A Brief Look at History
</summary>

The binary tree inversion algorithm gained widespread recognition in the programming community after a humorous tweet by Max Howell, the creator of the popular package manager Homebrew. In 2015, he tweeted about being rejected from a Google interview for failing to invert a binary tree. This sparked discussions about the relevance of algorithm questions in technical interviews and made this particular algorithm famous as a symbol of the disconnect between practical programming skills and interview assessments. Despite the controversy, the algorithm remains a valuable educational tool for understanding tree manipulation and recursion.
