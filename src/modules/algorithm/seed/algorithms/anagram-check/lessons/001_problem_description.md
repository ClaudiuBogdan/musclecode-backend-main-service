# 🧩 Understanding Anagrams

## What is an Anagram? 

An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, using all the original letters exactly once. 

For example:
- "listen" and "silent" are anagrams
- "triangle" and "integral" are anagrams
- "debit card" and "bad credit" are anagrams

## 🎯 Our Challenge

Given two strings, we need to determine if they are anagrams of each other. In other words, we need to check if both strings contain exactly the same characters with the same frequency, regardless of their order.

### Examples:

```
Input: s1 = "listen", s2 = "silent"
Output: true
```

```
Input: s1 = "hello", s2 = "world"
Output: false
```

## 🤔 Why is this Important?

Anagram checking is a fundamental string processing problem that appears in:
- Word games and puzzles
- Text analysis and natural language processing
- Cryptography
- Database operations for finding similar text entries
- Spell checking algorithms

## 💭 Think About It

Before diving into solutions, take a moment to consider:

1. What makes two strings anagrams of each other?
2. What's the simplest way to check if two strings have the same characters?
3. What are some edge cases we should consider?

In the next lesson, we'll start exploring different approaches to solve this problem efficiently!

> 💡 **Tip**: The key insight for anagram checking is that two strings must have identical character frequencies to be anagrams.
