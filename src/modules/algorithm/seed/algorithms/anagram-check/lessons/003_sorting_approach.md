# 🔄 The Sorting Approach

One of the most intuitive ways to check if two strings are anagrams is to sort both strings and then compare them. If they're anagrams, the sorted strings will be identical.

## 📝 The Algorithm

Here's how the sorting approach works:

1. Check if the strings have the same length (as we learned in the previous lesson)
2. Sort both strings alphabetically
3. Compare the sorted strings character by character

## 💻 Implementation

```javascript
function isAnagram(s1, s2) {
  // Check if lengths are equal
  if (s1.length !== s2.length) return false;
  
  // Sort both strings
  const sortedS1 = s1.split('').sort().join('');
  const sortedS2 = s2.split('').sort().join('');
  
  // Compare sorted strings
  return sortedS1 === sortedS2;
}
```

## 🔍 How It Works

Let's trace through an example:

**Example**: `s1 = "listen"`, `s2 = "silent"`

1. Check lengths: both are 6 characters ✓
2. Sort `s1`: `"listen"` → `"eilnst"`
3. Sort `s2`: `"silent"` → `"eilnst"`
4. Compare: `"eilnst"` === `"eilnst"` ✓
5. Return `true`

## 📊 Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(n log n), where n is the length of the strings
  - Sorting takes O(n log n) time
  - Comparison takes O(n) time
  - Overall complexity is dominated by the sorting operation

- **Space Complexity**: O(n)
  - We need to create new sorted strings, which requires additional space

## 🤔 When to Use This Approach

The sorting approach is:
- Easy to understand and implement
- Good for educational purposes
- Suitable for interviews where clarity is valued

However, it's not the most efficient solution for very large strings due to the O(n log n) time complexity.

## 💭 Think About It

Can you think of a way to check if two strings are anagrams without sorting them? What data structure might help us count character frequencies more efficiently?

> 💡 **Tip**: While sorting is intuitive, there's a more efficient approach using character counting that we'll explore in the next lesson.
