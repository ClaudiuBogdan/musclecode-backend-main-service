# 🔍 Initial Checks

Before diving into the core algorithm, we need to perform some preliminary checks that can save us time and computational resources.

## ⚖️ Length Equality Check

The first and most obvious check is to compare the lengths of both strings:

```javascript
if (s1.length !== s2.length) return false;
```

**Why is this important?** 🤔

Two strings can only be anagrams if they have the same length. If the lengths are different, it's impossible for them to contain exactly the same characters with the same frequency.

This simple check allows us to quickly eliminate non-anagram pairs without performing any further processing.

## 🧪 Edge Cases

Let's consider some edge cases:

### Empty Strings

```javascript
if (s1 === '' && s2 === '') return true;
```

Two empty strings are considered anagrams of each other since they both contain exactly the same characters (none) with the same frequency.

### Case Sensitivity

Depending on the requirements, you might need to handle case sensitivity:

```javascript
// Case-insensitive comparison
s1 = s1.toLowerCase();
s2 = s2.toLowerCase();
```

### Special Characters and Spaces

In some applications, you might want to ignore spaces and special characters:

```javascript
// Remove non-alphanumeric characters
s1 = s1.replace(/[^a-zA-Z0-9]/g, '');
s2 = s2.replace(/[^a-zA-Z0-9]/g, '');
```

## 💡 Quick Optimization

For very long strings, these initial checks can save significant processing time. Always start with the simplest and most efficient checks before moving on to more complex operations.

> 🚨 **Common Pitfall**: Forgetting to check string lengths is a common mistake that can lead to unnecessary processing and potential bugs in your implementation.

In the next lesson, we'll explore our first approach to solving the anagram check problem: the sorting method.
