### The Hamiltonian Cycle in a Nutshell:

> [!NOTE]
> The Hamiltonian Cycle algorithm uses backtracking to find a cycle that visits each vertex exactly once and returns to the starting point. It handles NP-completeness by systematically exploring and pruning paths.

## üèãÔ∏è Practice Exercises

### Exercise 1: Basic Identification

Determine if each of the following graphs has a Hamiltonian Cycle. If so, provide one example cycle.

Graph A:
```mermaid
graph TD;
    A---B;
    A---C;
    B---C;
    B---D;
    C---D;
    C---E;
    D---E;
```

Graph B:
```mermaid
graph TD;
    A---B;
    A---C;
    B---D;
    C---D;
    D---E;
```

<details>
<summary>Solutions</summary>

Graph A: Yes, it has a Hamiltonian Cycle. One example is A ‚Üí B ‚Üí D ‚Üí E ‚Üí C ‚Üí A.

Graph B: No, it doesn't have a Hamiltonian Cycle. The vertex E has only one connection, so any path that visits E can't return to another vertex without revisiting a vertex.
</details>

### Exercise 2: Tracing the Algorithm

Trace through our backtracking algorithm on the following graph, showing the first few steps of execution:

```mermaid
graph TD;
    0---1;
    0---2;
    1---2;
    1---3;
    2---3;
```

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

Initial state:
- `path = [0, -1, -1, -1]` (starting at vertex 0)
- `visited = [true, false, false, false]`

Call `hamCycleUtil(graph, path, visited, 1)`:

Try vertex 1:
- `path = [0, 1, -1, -1]`
- `visited = [true, true, false, false]`
- Call `hamCycleUtil(graph, path, visited, 2)`

Try vertex 2:
- `path = [0, 1, 2, -1]`
- `visited = [true, true, true, false]`
- Call `hamCycleUtil(graph, path, visited, 3)`

Try vertex 3:
- `path = [0, 1, 2, 3]`
- `visited = [true, true, true, true]`
- Base case: All vertices are visited
- Check if `graph[3][0] == 1`: No edge between vertex 3 and 0
- Backtrack and try another path

Try vertex 3 (from vertex 1):
- `path = [0, 1, 3, -1]`
- `visited = [true, true, false, true]`
- Call `hamCycleUtil(graph, path, visited, 3)`

And so on...

### Exercise 3: Code Modification

Modify the Hamiltonian Cycle algorithm to find a Hamiltonian Path instead of a cycle (where you don't need to return to the starting vertex). What changes would you need to make?

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

For a Hamiltonian Path, the main change is in the base case of the `hamCycleUtil` function:

```
function hamCycleUtil(graph, path, visited, position):
    // Base case: all vertices are included in the path
    if position == numVertices:
        // No need to check for a cycle back to start
        return true
    
    // Rest of the function remains the same
    ...
```

Also, in the main function, we don't need to append the starting vertex to the path at the end:

```
function findHamiltonianPath(graph):
    ...
    if hamCycleUtil(graph, path, visited, 1):
        return path  // No need to complete the cycle
    ...
```
</details>

### Exercise 4: Real-World Application

Design a small real-world problem that can be modeled as a Hamiltonian Cycle problem. Create the corresponding graph and solve it using our algorithm.

<details>
<summary>Example Solution</summary>

**Problem**: A delivery driver needs to deliver packages to 4 locations and return to the warehouse. The road network only allows certain direct connections between locations.

**Graph**:
- Vertices: Warehouse (W), Location A, Location B, Location C, Location D
- Edges: W-A, W-C, A-B, A-D, B-C, B-D, C-D, D-W

This can be represented by the adjacency matrix:
```
[0, 1, 0, 1, 0] // Warehouse
[1, 0, 1, 0, 1] // Location A
[0, 1, 0, 1, 1] // Location B
[1, 0, 1, 0, 1] // Location C
[0, 1, 1, 1, 0] // Location D
```

The Hamiltonian Cycle solution would be: W ‚Üí A ‚Üí B ‚Üí C ‚Üí D ‚Üí W

## üöÄ Further Learning

To deepen your understanding of the Hamiltonian Cycle problem and related concepts:

1. **Explore Variations**: Implement the Traveling Salesperson Problem using Hamiltonian Cycles
2. **Study Graph Theory**: Learn more about graph properties that guarantee Hamiltonian Cycles
3. **Try Optimization**: Implement heuristic methods for finding approximate solutions to large instances
4. **Apply to Real Problems**: Use your knowledge to solve real-world routing or scheduling problems

> [!TIP]
> The best way to master algorithms is through practice! Try implementing the algorithm in different programming languages and testing it on various graphs.

## üèÜ Final Challenge

Implement an optimized version of the Hamiltonian Cycle algorithm that can handle larger graphs more efficiently. Consider adding heuristics or additional pruning strategies to improve performance.

<details>
<summary>Optimization Ideas</summary>

- **Degree Heuristic**: Try vertices with higher degrees first
- **Look-ahead Pruning**: Check if adding a vertex would create a dead-end later
- **Branch Ordering**: Order the branches of the search tree based on promising solutions
- **Parallelization**: Explore multiple branches of the search tree in parallel
- **Iterative Deepening**: Gradually increase the depth of the search
