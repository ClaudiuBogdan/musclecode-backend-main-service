# 🧩 Prerequisites for Learning AVL Trees

Before diving into AVL trees, it's important to ensure you have a solid understanding of certain fundamental concepts. This will make your learning journey smoother and more productive.

## Binary Search Trees: The Foundation 🌱

AVL trees are a specialized type of Binary Search Tree (BST), so understanding BSTs is essential. Here's a quick refresher:

### Binary Search Tree Properties

A Binary Search Tree is a tree data structure where:

1. Each node has at most two children (left and right)
2. The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with values less than the node's value
3. The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with values greater than the node's value
4. Both left and right subtrees are also binary search trees

```
      8
     / \
    3   10
   / \    \
  1   6    14
     / \   /
    4   7 13
```

This is a valid BST because all values in each node's left subtree are less than the node's value, and all values in each node's right subtree are greater than the node's value.

### Basic BST Operations

You should be familiar with these standard operations:

1. **Search**: Finding a node with a specific value
2. **Insert**: Adding a new node while maintaining the BST property
3. **Delete**: Removing a node while maintaining the BST property
4. **Traversal**: Visiting all nodes in a specific order (in-order, pre-order, post-order)

### The Problem with Regular BSTs

Regular BSTs can become unbalanced, leading to poor performance. In the worst case, a BST can degenerate into a linked list:

```
1
 \
  2
   \
    3
     \
      4
       \
        5
```

In this case, operations have O(n) time complexity instead of the expected O(log n).

## Recursion: A Key Technique 🔄

AVL tree operations are often implemented recursively. You should be comfortable with:

1. **Recursive functions**: Functions that call themselves
2. **Base cases**: Conditions that stop the recursion
3. **Call stack**: Understanding how function calls are managed

Here's a simple recursive implementation of a BST search operation:

```javascript
function search(root, target) {
  // Base case 1: Tree is empty
  if (!root) return null;
  
  // Base case 2: Found the target
  if (root.value === target) return root;
  
  // Recursive case: Search in the appropriate subtree
  if (target < root.value) {
    return search(root.left, target);
  } else {
    return search(root.right, target);
  }
}
```

## Time and Space Complexity Analysis ⏱️

You should understand the concepts of:

1. **Big O notation**: For analyzing algorithm efficiency
2. **Time complexity**: How execution time grows with input size
3. **Space complexity**: How memory usage grows with input size
4. **Best, average, and worst cases**: Different performance scenarios

## Tree Traversals 🚶

Be familiar with the three main tree traversal methods:

1. **In-Order Traversal**: Visit left subtree, then root, then right subtree (results in sorted order for BSTs)
2. **Pre-Order Traversal**: Visit root, then left subtree, then right subtree
3. **Post-Order Traversal**: Visit left subtree, then right subtree, then root

## Data Structures for Implementation 📚

You should be comfortable with these basic data structures:

1. **Linked nodes**: Using objects with pointers/references
2. **Recursion**: For implementing tree operations
3. **Arrays and lists**: For storing tree elements
4. **Queues**: For level-order traversal

## Programming Concepts 💻

Make sure you understand:

1. **Object-oriented programming**: For implementing tree classes and nodes
2. **Recursion**: For tree operations
3. **Pointers/references**: For managing tree connections
4. **Memory management**: For creating and deleting nodes

## Self-Assessment Quiz 📝

Test your readiness with this quick quiz:

1. What is the defining property of a Binary Search Tree?
2. What's the time complexity of searching in a balanced BST?
3. How do you find the minimum value in a BST?
4. What traversal method would you use to print BST values in sorted order?
5. What's the problem with unbalanced BSTs?

<details>
<summary>Check your answers</summary>

1. For every node, all values in the left subtree are less than the node's value, and all values in the right subtree are greater than the node's value.
2. O(log n) for balanced BSTs.
3. Follow the left child pointers until you reach a node with no left child.
4. In-order traversal.
5. They can degenerate into linked lists, causing operations to have O(n) complexity instead of O(log n).
