"""
Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm implementation for graphs represented as adjacency lists.

Args:
    graph: A dictionary representing the graph as an adjacency list where keys are vertices
           and values are lists of adjacent vertices
    start: The starting vertex for the BFS traversal

Returns:
    A list containing the vertices in the order they were visited during BFS traversal
