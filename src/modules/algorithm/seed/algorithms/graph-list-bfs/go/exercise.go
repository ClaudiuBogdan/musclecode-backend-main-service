package graphlistbfs

// BFS performs a breadth-first search traversal on a graph represented as an adjacency list.
// It returns an array containing the vertices in the order they were visited during BFS traversal.
//
// Parameters:
//   - graph: A map representing the graph as an adjacency list where keys are vertices
//     and values are slices of adjacent vertices
//   - start: The starting vertex for the BFS traversal
//
// Returns:
//   - A slice containing the vertices in the order they were visited during BFS traversal
func BFS(graph map[interface{}][]interface{}, start interface{}) []interface{} {
	// TODO: Implement the BFS algorithm
	return nil
