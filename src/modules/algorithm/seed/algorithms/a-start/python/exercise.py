    """
    Finds the shortest path from start to goal in a grid using the A* search algorithm.
    Cells with value 0 are walkable and 1 represent obstacles.

    Args:
        grid: A list of lists of integers (0 for free, 1 for obstacle)
        start: Starting coordinates [x, y]
        goal: Goal coordinates [x, y]

    Returns:
        A list of coordinate pairs representing the path from start to goal,
        or an empty list if no path exists.
