package dfs

// DFS performs a Depth-First Search (DFS) traversal on a graph.
//
// Parameters:
//   graph: A map representing the graph as an adjacency list
//          where keys are vertices and values are slices of adjacent vertices
//   startVertex: The vertex to start the DFS traversal from
//
// Returns:
//   A slice containing the vertices in the order they were visited
func DFS(graph map[string][]string, startVertex string) []string {
	// Your implementation here
	return []string{}
