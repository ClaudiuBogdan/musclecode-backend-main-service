# üöÄ Optimizations and Special Cases for Hamiltonian Paths

While we've covered the classic algorithms for finding Hamiltonian Paths, there are numerous optimizations and special cases worth exploring. These can dramatically improve performance or simplify the problem in specific scenarios.

## üîç Early Detection of Impossible Cases

Before running any algorithm, we can quickly rule out some graphs:

> [!TIP]
> Quick checks can save significant computation time by identifying impossible cases early!

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Connectivity Check

If the graph is not connected, it can't have a Hamiltonian Path.

```python
def is_connected(graph):
    n = len(graph)
    if n == 0:
        return False
    
    visited = [False] * n
    queue = [0]  # Start BFS from vertex 0
    visited[0] = True
    
    while queue:
        vertex = queue.pop(0)
        for i in range(n):
            if graph[vertex][i] == 1 and not visited[i]:
                visited[i] = True
                queue.append(i)
    
    return all(visited)  # All vertices must be reachable
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Degree Check

A vertex with degree 0 (except in a single-vertex graph) means the graph can't have a Hamiltonian Path.

```python
def has_isolated_vertex(graph):
    n = len(graph)
    for i in range(n):
        if sum(graph[i]) == 0:
            return True
    return False
```

## üß© Special Graph Structures

Some graph types have known properties regarding Hamiltonian Paths:

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Complete Graphs

> [!NOTE]
> A complete graph (where every vertex is connected to every other vertex) always has a Hamiltonian Path.

In fact, any permutation of vertices forms a valid Hamiltonian Path!

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A --- B;
    A --- C;
    A --- D;
    B --- C;
    B --- D;
    C --- D;
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Path Graphs

A path graph (a simple chain of vertices) has exactly one Hamiltonian Path: the path itself.

```mermaid
graph LR;
    A --- B;
    B --- C;
    C --- D;
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Cycle Graphs

A cycle graph (a simple loop of vertices) has exactly n different Hamiltonian Paths, where n is the number of vertices.

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A --- B;
    B --- C;
    C --- D;
    D --- A;
```

## üí° Algorithmic Optimizations

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Branch and Bound

We can enhance the backtracking approach with "pruning" techniques:

```python
def hamiltonian_path_with_pruning(graph):
    n = len(graph)
    path = []
    visited = [False] * n
    
    def find_path(v, depth):
        path.append(v)
        visited[v] = True
        
        if depth == n:
            return True
            
        # Sort neighbors by degree (fewer options first)
        neighbors = []
        for i in range(n):
            if graph[v][i] == 1 and not visited[i]:
                neighbors.append((i, sum(1 for j in range(n) if graph[i][j] == 1 and not visited[j])))
        
        # Try vertices with fewer unvisited neighbors first
        for next_v, _ in sorted(neighbors, key=lambda x: x[1]):
            if find_path(next_v, depth + 1):
                return True
                
        # Backtrack
        path.pop()
        visited[v] = False
        return False
    
    for start_node in range(n):
        if find_path(start_node, 1):
            return True
        path.clear()
        visited = [False] * n
        
    return False
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Heuristic Approaches

For very large graphs, we might use heuristics like:

- **Nearest Neighbor**: Always move to the closest unvisited vertex
- **Genetic Algorithms**: Evolve potential paths over generations
- **Simulated Annealing**: Probabilistically explore the solution space

<summary>Nearest Neighbor Heuristic Example</summary>

```python
def nearest_neighbor_hamiltonian(graph):
    n = len(graph)
    path = [0]  # Start at vertex 0
    visited = [False] * n
    visited[0] = True
    
    while len(path) < n:
        current = path[-1]
        next_vertex = -1
        min_degree = float('inf')
        
        # Find unvisited neighbor with minimum degree
        for i in range(n):
            if graph[current][i] == 1 and not visited[i]:
                degree = sum(graph[i])
                if degree < min_degree:
                    min_degree = degree
                    next_vertex = i
        
        if next_vertex == -1:
            return None  # No Hamiltonian path
        
        path.append(next_vertex)
        visited[next_vertex] = True
    
    return path
```

## üß† Think About It

1. How would the algorithm change if you needed to find all possible Hamiltonian Paths?
2. For which types of real-world networks might you expect to find Hamiltonian Paths more easily?
3. Can you think of a heuristic that would work particularly well for sparse graphs?
