# The Recursive Quick Sort Algorithm ðŸ”„

> [!NOTE]
> In this lesson, we'll put together everything we've learned to implement the complete Quick Sort algorithm using recursion.

## Putting It All Together ðŸ§©

Now that we understand pivoting and partitioning, we can implement the complete Quick Sort algorithm:

1. If the array has 0 or 1 elements, it's already sorted (base case)
2. Otherwise:
   - Choose a pivot element
   - Partition the array around the pivot
   - Recursively sort the left subarray (elements less than pivot)
   - Recursively sort the right subarray (elements greater than pivot)

## Visualizing the Complete Process ðŸ“Š

Let's trace through the entire Quick Sort process with our example: `[7, 2, 1, 6, 8, 5, 3, 4]`

```mermaid
graph TD
    A["[7, 2, 1, 6, 8, 5, 3, 4]"] --> B["Partition around 4"]
    B --> C["[2, 1, 3, 4, 8, 5, 7, 6]"]
    C --> D["[2, 1, 3]"] 
    C --> E["[8, 5, 7, 6]"]
    
    D --> F["Partition around 3"]
    F --> G["[2, 1, 3]"]
    G --> H["[2, 1]"]
    G --> I["[]"]
    
    H --> J["Partition around 1"]
    J --> K["[1, 2]"]
    K --> L["[]"]
    K --> M["[2]"]
    
    E --> N["Partition around 6"]
    N --> O["[5, 6, 7, 8]"]
    O --> P["[5]"]
    O --> Q["[7, 8]"]
    
    Q --> R["Partition around 8"]
    R --> S["[7, 8]"]
    S --> T["[7]"]
    S --> U["[]"]
    
    L & I & M & P & T & U --> V["Combine (already in place)"]
    V --> W["[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]"]
```

## The Recursive Quick Sort Code ðŸ’»

Here's the complete implementation in JavaScript:

```javascript
function quickSort(nums) {
  // Create a copy to avoid mutating the original array
  const arr = [...nums];
  
  // Call the helper function with initial bounds
  quickSortHelper(arr, 0, arr.length - 1);
  
  return arr;
}

function quickSortHelper(arr, low, high) {
  // Base case: If the partition has 0 or 1 elements, it's already sorted
  if (low < high) {
    // Partition the array and get the pivot index
    const pivotIndex = partition(arr, low, high);
    
    // Recursively sort the left subarray
    quickSortHelper(arr, low, pivotIndex - 1);
    
    // Recursively sort the right subarray
    quickSortHelper(arr, pivotIndex + 1, high);
  }
}

function partition(arr, low, high) {
  const pivot = arr[high]; // Using last element as pivot
  let i = low;             // Index of smaller element
  
  for (let j = low; j < high; j++) {
    // If current element is smaller than the pivot
    if (arr[j] < pivot) {
      // Swap arr[i] and arr[j]
      [arr[i], arr[j]] = [arr[j], arr[i]];
      i++;
    }
  }
  
  // Swap arr[i] and arr[high] (put the pivot in its final position)
  [arr[i], arr[high]] = [arr[high], arr[i]];
  return i; // Return the pivot's index
}
```

## Understanding the Recursion ðŸ§ 

<details>
<summary>Click to explore the recursive nature of Quick Sort</summary>

The recursive structure of Quick Sort might seem complex, but it follows a simple pattern:

1. Each recursive call works on a smaller subarray
2. The base case (arrays of size 0 or 1) stops the recursion
3. As the recursion unwinds, the array becomes fully sorted

Think of it like a tree of tasks, where each branch handles a smaller and smaller portion of the array until everything is sorted!
</details>

## The Base Case â›”

Every recursive algorithm needs a base case to prevent infinite recursion. For Quick Sort, the base case is when the subarray has 0 or 1 elements.

Why? Because an array with a single element is already sorted! There's nothing to do.

This is represented by the condition `if (low < high)` - if this is false, it means the subarray has 0 or 1 elements.

## The Space Complexity of Recursion ðŸ“š

<details>
<summary>Click to understand space usage in recursive Quick Sort</summary>

Each recursive call adds a new frame to the call stack, requiring space to store local variables and return addresses.

In the best case (balanced partitions), the maximum recursion depth is logâ‚‚n, giving O(log n) space complexity.

In the worst case (highly unbalanced partitions), the recursion depth could be n, leading to O(n) space complexity.
</details>

> [!TIP]
> If you're concerned about recursion depth (especially for large arrays), an iterative version using an explicit stack can be implemented.

## Try It Yourself ðŸŽ¯

By hand, trace through the quick sort algorithm for the array: `[5, 3, 7, 6, 2, 9]`

In the next lesson, we'll look at an alternative iterative implementation that achieves the same results without using recursion.
