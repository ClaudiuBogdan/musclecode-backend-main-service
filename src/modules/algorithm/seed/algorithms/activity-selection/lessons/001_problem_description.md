# üéØ The Activity Selection Problem

Imagine you're planning your day and have a list of activities you'd like to do. Each activity has a specific start time and end time. Unfortunately, some activities overlap, and you can only do one thing at a time! 

**How do you select the maximum number of activities you can complete?** ü§î

## üåü Real-World Examples

This problem appears in many everyday scenarios:
- üìÖ Scheduling meetings in a conference room
- üè´ Planning classes in a classroom
- üé¨ Booking movie sessions in a theater
- üíª Allocating processor time for various tasks

## üìù Problem Definition

Given:
- A set of activities, each with a start time and finish time
- A single resource that can only be used by one activity at a time

Goal:
- Select the **maximum number** of non-overlapping activities

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Important: We're trying to maximize the **number of activities**, not the total time used or any other measure.

## üß© Example

Let's look at a simple example:

Activity | Start Time | End Time
---------|------------|----------
A        | 9:00       | 10:30
B        | 9:30       | 10:30
C        | 10:00      | 11:00
D        | 11:00      | 12:00
E        | 10:30      | 12:30
F        | 12:30      | 13:30

Which activities would you choose to maximize the number you can complete? Take a moment to think about it...

üí° **Question to consider**: Is there a simple strategy we could use to approach this problem efficiently?

In the next lesson, we'll explore how to think about this problem and develop an intuitive approach to solving it.
