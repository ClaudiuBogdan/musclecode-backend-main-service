# üéØ The Activity Selection Problem

Imagine you're planning your day and have a list of activities you'd like to do. Each activity has a specific start time and end time. Unfortunately, some activities overlap, and you can only do one thing at a time! 

**How do you select the maximum number of activities you can complete?** ü§î

## üåü Real-World Examples

This problem appears in many everyday scenarios:
- üìÖ Scheduling meetings in a conference room
- üè´ Planning classes in a classroom
- üé¨ Booking movie sessions in a theater
- üíª Allocating processor time for various tasks

## üìä Visual Representation

Let's visualize the problem to make it more intuitive:

```
       A: |-------|
    B:    |-------|
  C:        |--|
      D:         |-------|
    E:            |-----------|
       F:                |---|
       
       9   10   11   12   13   14
       |    |    |    |    |    |
      Time ‚Üí
```

In this timeline, each bar represents an activity with its start and end time. You can see some activities overlap, making it impossible to do all of them.

## üìù Problem Definition

Given:
- A set of activities, each with a start time and finish time
- A single resource that can only be used by one activity at a time

Goal:
- Select the **maximum number** of non-overlapping activities

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Important: We're trying to maximize the **number of activities**, not the total time used or any other measure.

## üß© Example

Let's look at a simple example:

Activity | Start Time | End Time
---------|------------|----------
A        | 9:00       | 10:30
B        | 9:30       | 10:30
C        | 10:00      | 11:00
D        | 11:00      | 12:00
E        | 10:30      | 12:30
F        | 12:30      | 13:30

Which activities would you choose to maximize the number you can complete? Take a moment to think about it...

## ü§î Try It Yourself

Before moving on, try to solve this simple version of the problem:

Activity | Start Time | End Time
---------|------------|----------
P        | 1:00       | 3:00
Q        | 2:00       | 4:00
R        | 3:00       | 5:00
S        | 4:00       | 6:00

Which activities would you select? Think about what strategy you're using to make your choices.

The optimal selection is activities P and R, for a total of 2 activities.
