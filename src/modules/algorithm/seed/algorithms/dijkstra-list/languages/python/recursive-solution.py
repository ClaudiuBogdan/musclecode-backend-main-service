def dijkstra(graph: Graph, source: str) -> DistanceMap:
    """
    Implements Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path from a source node
    to all other nodes in a weighted graph using a recursive approach.
    
    Args:
        graph: An adjacency list representation of a weighted graph
               where keys are node names and values are lists of edges
               Each edge is a dictionary with 'node' and 'weight' keys
        source: The source node to start the algorithm from
        
    Returns:
        A dictionary mapping each node to its shortest distance from the source
        
    Time Complexity: O(VÂ²) where V is the number of vertices
    Space Complexity: O(V) for storing distances and the visited set, plus O(V) for the recursion stack
    
    The implementation:
    - Uses a recursive approach to process nodes in order of increasing distance
    - Maintains a distance map to track the shortest known distance to each node
    - Processes the node with the smallest tentative distance at each step
    - Updates distances when shorter paths are found
    - Returns the final distance map when all reachable nodes have been processed
