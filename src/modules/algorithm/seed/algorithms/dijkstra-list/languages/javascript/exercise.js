 * Implements Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path from a source node

 * @param {Object} graph - An adjacency list representation of a weighted graph
 *                        where keys are node names and values are arrays of edges
 *                        Each edge is an object with 'node' and 'weight' properties
 * @param {string} source - The source node to start the algorithm from
 * @returns {Object} A map of nodes to their shortest distance from the source
