# Maximum Sum Subarray Using Sliding Window

The Maximum Sum Subarray algorithm using the sliding window technique is an efficient approach to find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray of a fixed size. This algorithm exemplifies how the sliding window pattern can transform a potentially O(nÂ²) solution into a linear time O(n) solution by avoiding redundant calculations.

## The Challenge

Given an array of integers `nums` and a positive integer `k`, find the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray of size `k`. The algorithm maintains a "window" of `k` elements and slides it through the array to find the subarray with the largest sum.

### Example 1

```js
Input: nums = [2, 1, 5, 1, 3, 2], k = 3
Output: 9
```

_Explanation: The subarray[^5][^1][^3] has the maximum sum of 9._

### Example 2

```js
Input: nums = [5, 6, 1, 2, 6, 6, 4, 3], k = 3
Output: 16
```

_Explanation: The subarray[^6][^6][^4] has the maximum sum of 16._

### Speed and Efficiency
</summary>

The sliding window approach offers significant performance benefits:

- **Time Complexity**: O(n) where n is the length of the array, as we only need to traverse the array once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) as we only use a constant amount of extra space regardless of input size.

This is a substantial improvement over the naive approach which would require O(n*k) time to calculate the sum for each possible subarray of size k.

### Key Principles
</summary>

The sliding window technique for maximum sum subarray is built on these fundamental concepts:

- **Window Formation**: Initially create a window of size `k` by calculating the sum of the first `k` elements.

- **Window Sliding**: Move the window forward by removing the element from the start and adding the next element.

- **Sum Maintenance**: Instead of recalculating the entire sum for each window, update it by subtracting the element that leaves the window and adding the new element.

- **Maximum Tracking**: Keep track of the maximum sum encountered as the window slides through the array.

### Common Pitfalls
</summary>

When implementing the sliding window technique for maximum sum subarray, be mindful of these common challenges:

- **Edge Cases**: Failing to handle arrays with length less than `k`.

- **Window Initialization**: Incorrectly calculating the sum of the first window.

- **Window Sliding Logic**: Errors in the addition/subtraction logic when sliding the window.

- **Maximum Sum Update**: Forgetting to update the maximum sum after each window slide.

- **Boundary Conditions**: Off-by-one errors when determining the end of the sliding process.

### When and Where to Use Maximum Sum Subarray
</summary>

This algorithm is ideal in scenarios such as:

- Finding the maximum profit in a fixed time period in financial analysis.

- Analyzing network traffic or resource usage over fixed intervals.

- Processing signal data to find periods of maximum intensity.

- Image processing where you need to find areas with maximum pixel values.

However, it may not be the best choice for:

- Variable-sized subarray problems (where Kadane's algorithm might be more appropriate).

- Sparse arrays where most elements are zeros (specialized algorithms may be more efficient).

- When the problem requires finding all subarrays with a sum above a threshold rather than just the maximum.

### A Brief Look at History
</summary>

The sliding window technique has been a fundamental algorithmic pattern in computer science for decades. While its exact origins are difficult to pinpoint, it emerged as programmers sought more efficient ways to process sequential data. The maximum sum subarray problem specifically gained prominence in algorithm textbooks and competitive programming as a classic example of how to optimize an intuitive but inefficient solution. The technique has since become a standard tool in the algorithm designer's toolkit, particularly for problems involving arrays, strings, and other sequential data structures.

### Pseudocode Implementation
</summary>

```
function maxSumSubarray(array, k):
    if length(array) < k:
        return "Error: Array length must be at least k"
    
    // Calculate sum of first k elements
    maxSum = 0
    windowSum = 0
    for i from 0 to k-1:
        windowSum += array[i]
    
    // Initialize maxSum with the sum of first window
    maxSum = windowSum
    
    // Slide the window and update maxSum
    for i from k to length(array)-1:
        // Remove the element leaving the window
        windowSum -= array[i-k]
        // Add the new element entering the window
        windowSum += array[i]
        // Update maxSum if current windowSum is greater
        maxSum = max(maxSum, windowSum)
    
    return maxSum
```

### Proof of Correctness
</summary>

The correctness of the sliding window algorithm for maximum sum subarray can be proven through the following logical steps:

1. **Initialization**: The algorithm correctly calculates the sum of the first k elements, establishing the initial window.

2. **Window Sliding**: For each step:
   - The element at position (i-k) is removed from the sum
   - The element at position i is added to the sum
   - This ensures that each window maintains exactly k consecutive elements

3. **Completeness**: The algorithm examines every possible contiguous subarray of size k by sliding the window from the beginning to the end of the array.

4. **Maximum Tracking**: After each window slide, the algorithm compares the current window sum with the maximum sum found so far and updates if necessary.

5. **Termination**: The algorithm terminates after examining all possible windows, which is guaranteed because:
   - The loop has a fixed upper bound (array length - k)
   - Each iteration moves the window exactly one position forward

6. **Invariant Maintenance**: Throughout execution, the algorithm maintains these invariants:
   - windowSum always contains the sum of k consecutive elements
   - maxSum always contains the maximum sum found so far

This proof demonstrates that the algorithm will always find the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray of size k in the given array.
