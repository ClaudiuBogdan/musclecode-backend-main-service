    Given two crystal balls that will break if dropped from high enough distance,
    determine the exact spot in which they will break in the most optimized way.

    Args:
        breaks (List[bool]): An array of booleans representing whether the ball breaks at that floor.

    Returns:
        int: The index where the balls start breaking, or -1 if they never break.
