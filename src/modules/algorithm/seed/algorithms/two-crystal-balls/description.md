# Two Crystal Balls Algorithm

The Two Crystal Balls algorithm is an elegant optimization problem that demonstrates how to efficiently determine a threshold value when given limited resources. It's a classic example of how mathematical thinking can dramatically improve algorithmic efficiency beyond naive approaches.

## The Challenge

Given two identical crystal balls that will break if dropped from a high enough distance, determine the exact floor (or height) at which they will break in the most optimized way. If a ball breaks when dropped from floor X, it will also break when dropped from any floor higher than X. If it doesn't break from floor X, it won't break from any floor lower than X.

### Example 1

```js
Input: [false, false, false, false, true, true, true]
Output: 4
```

_Explanation: The balls start breaking at index 4 (the 5th floor)._

### Example 2

```js
Input: [false, false, false, false, false, false, false]
Output: -1
```

_Explanation: The balls never break, so the function returns -1._

### Speed and Efficiency
</summary>

The Two Crystal Balls algorithm demonstrates a significant optimization over naive approaches:

- **Time Complexity**:
  - **Naive Approach (Linear Search):** $O(n)$ - checking each floor one by one
  - **Binary Search Approach:** Not viable due to the constraint of having only two balls
  - **Optimal Solution:** $O(\sqrt{n})$ - jumping by square root intervals
- **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$ as it requires only a constant amount of extra space regardless of input size.

### Key Principles
</summary>

The algorithm is built on several key insights:

- **Resource Conservation:** With only two balls, we must carefully plan how to use each one.

- **Jump-then-Linear Strategy:** Use the first ball to identify a range, then the second ball for precise determination.

- **Square Root Jumping:** The mathematical insight that jumping by $\sqrt{n}$ intervals minimizes the worst-case number of drops.

- **Worst-Case Optimization:** The algorithm is designed to minimize the maximum number of drops required in any scenario.

- **Monotonicity Property:** Leverages the fact that if a ball breaks at floor X, it will break at all floors above X.

### Common Pitfalls
</summary>

When implementing the Two Crystal Balls algorithm, be mindful of these common challenges:

- **Incorrect Jump Size:** Using a jump size other than $\sqrt{n}$ will result in suboptimal performance.

- **Off-by-One Errors:** Miscalculating the starting point for the linear search after the first ball breaks.

- **Edge Cases:** Failing to handle scenarios where the balls never break or break at the very first floor.

- **Premature Optimization:** Attempting to use binary search, which doesn't work with the two-ball constraint.

### When and Where to Use Two Crystal Balls Algorithm
</summary>

This algorithm is particularly useful in scenarios such as:

- **Threshold Detection:** Finding the exact point where a state change occurs in a monotonic sequence.

- **Resource-Constrained Testing:** When testing resources are limited and each test has a potential cost.

- **Quality Assurance:** Determining minimum requirements for product failure with limited test samples.

- **Network Latency Testing:** Finding bandwidth thresholds with limited probe attempts.

However, it may not be the best choice for:

- **Non-monotonic Data:** Where the property being tested doesn't follow a clear threshold pattern.

- **Unlimited Resources:** When there's no constraint on the number of tests that can be performed.

The Two Crystal Balls problem has practical applications beyond theoretical computer science:

- **Software Testing:** Determining the minimum load at which a system fails.

- **Materials Science:** Testing material breaking points with limited samples.

- **Network Engineering:** Finding bandwidth thresholds with minimal probing.

- **Quality Control:** Determining minimum requirements for product failure with limited test units.

- **Binary Deployment:** Finding problematic commits in a sequence with limited test environments.

Several variations and related algorithms exist:

- **Multiple Crystal Balls:** Extensions where more than two balls are available, allowing for even more efficient algorithms.

- **Egg Dropping Puzzle:** A classic variation where you determine the highest floor from which eggs can be dropped without breaking.

- **r-ary Representation:** Using different number systems to optimize for more than two balls.

- **Dynamic Programming Solution:** For the generalized k-balls, n-floors problem.

### Pseudocode Implementation
</summary>

```
function twoCrystalBalls(breaks):
    // Calculate jump length with sqrt of array length
    jumpLength = floor(sqrt(breaks.length))
    
    // First phase: Use first ball to find approximate breaking point
    i = 0
    while i < breaks.length:
        if breaks[i] is true:
            break
        i = i + jumpLength
    
    // Second phase: Use second ball for precise determination
    // Go back to the last known safe position
    i = i - jumpLength
    
    // Linear search from the last safe position
    for j = i to min(i + jumpLength - 1, breaks.length - 1):
        if breaks[j] is true:
            return j
    
    // If no breaking point found
    return -1
```

### Proof of Correctness
</summary>

The Two Crystal Balls algorithm's correctness can be proven through the following logical steps:

1. **Completeness:** The algorithm examines the array in two phases:
   - Phase 1: Jumps by √n intervals until finding a breaking point
   - Phase 2: Linearly searches the last interval before breaking

2. **Termination:** The algorithm is guaranteed to terminate because:
   - The jump phase has a maximum of √n iterations
   - The linear search phase examines at most √n elements
   - Both phases have clear termination conditions

3. **Correctness of Match:** When a breaking point is found:
   - In Phase 1: We identify the approximate range
   - In Phase 2: We find the exact first occurrence of a true value

4. **Correctness of Not Found Case:** If no breaking point exists:
   - Either Phase 1 completes without finding a true value
   - Or Phase 2 completes without finding a true value
   - The algorithm correctly returns -1

5. **Optimality:** The algorithm achieves O(√n) time complexity because:
   - At most √n jumps are performed in Phase 1
   - At most √n steps are performed in Phase 2
   - The sum of these operations is 2√n, which is O(√n)

This proof demonstrates that the Two Crystal Balls algorithm will always:
- Find the first breaking point if it exists
- Correctly report when no breaking point exists
- Do so in O(√n) time, which is optimal given the constraints
