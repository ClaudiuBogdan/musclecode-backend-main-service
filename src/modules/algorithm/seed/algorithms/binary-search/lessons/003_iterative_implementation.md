# ðŸ”„ Implementing Binary Search: The Iterative Approach

Now that we understand the core concept, let's implement binary search using an iterative approach. This is the most common and memory-efficient way to implement the algorithm.

## The Code

```javascript
function binarySearch(nums, target) {
  let left = 0;
  let right = nums.length - 1;

  while (left <= right) {
    const mid = left + Math.floor((right - left) / 2);

    if (nums[mid] === target) {
      return mid;
    }

    if (nums[mid] < target) {
      left = mid + 1;
    } else {
      right = mid - 1;
    }
  }

  return -1;
}
```

## Breaking Down the Implementation

### 1. Initialize the Search Range

```javascript
let left = 0;
let right = nums.length - 1;
```

We start by defining our search space:
- `left` points to the first element (index 0)
- `right` points to the last element (index `nums.length - 1`)

### 2. The Main Loop

```javascript
while (left <= right) {
  // ...
}
```

We continue searching as long as our search space contains at least one element (`left <= right`). When `left` becomes greater than `right`, it means we've exhausted our search space without finding the target.

### 3. Finding the Middle Element

```javascript
const mid = left + Math.floor((right - left) / 2);
```

> [!TIP]
> We use `left + Math.floor((right - left) / 2)` instead of the simpler `Math.floor((left + right) / 2)` to avoid potential integer overflow in languages where this might be an issue.

### 4. Comparing and Adjusting

```javascript
if (nums[mid] === target) {
  return mid;
}

if (nums[mid] < target) {
  left = mid + 1;
} else {
  right = mid - 1;
}
```

This is the heart of the algorithm:
- If we found the target, return its index
- If the middle value is less than the target, the target must be in the right half
- If the middle value is greater than the target, the target must be in the left half

### 5. Not Found Case

```javascript
return -1;
```

If we exit the loop without finding the target, it doesn't exist in the array, so we return -1.

## Tracing Through an Example

Let's trace through our code with the example from before: searching for `4` in `[-1, 0, 2, 4, 6, 8]`.

| Iteration | left | right | mid | nums[mid] | Comparison | Action |
|-----------|------|-------|-----|-----------|------------|--------|
| Initial   | 0    | 5     | -   | -         | -          | -      |
| 1         | 0    | 5     | 2   | 2         | 4 > 2      | left = mid + 1 = 3 |
| 2         | 3    | 5     | 4   | 6         | 4 < 6      | right = mid - 1 = 3 |
| 3         | 3    | 3     | 3   | 4         | 4 = 4      | Return mid = 3 |

## Time and Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(log n)
  - Each iteration eliminates half of the remaining elements
  - For an array of size n, we need at most logâ‚‚(n) iterations

- **Space Complexity**: O(1)
  - We only use a constant amount of extra space (the variables `left`, `right`, and `mid`)
  - This is one advantage of the iterative approach over the recursive approach

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

> [!WARNING]
> 1. **Off-by-one errors**: Make sure your loop condition is `left <= right` (not `<`), so you don't miss the case where the target is the only element left.
> 2. **Infinite loops**: Ensure you're properly updating `left` and `right` to narrow the search space.
> 3. **Integer overflow**: Use `left + Math.floor((right - left) / 2)` instead of `Math.floor((left + right) / 2)` for calculating the middle.

## Try It Yourself

<details>
<summary>What would happen if we changed the loop condition from `left <= right` to `left < right`?</summary>

If we used `left < right`, the algorithm would stop when there's only one element left (when `left` equals `right`). This would cause the algorithm to miss the target if it happens to be the last element in our search space.

In the next lesson, we'll explore an alternative implementation using recursion and compare it with the iterative approach.
