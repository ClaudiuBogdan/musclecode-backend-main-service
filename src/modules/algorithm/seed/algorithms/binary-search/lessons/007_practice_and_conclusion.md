## Practice Problems

### Problem 1: Basic Binary Search

Implement binary search to find a target in a sorted array. Return the index if found, -1 otherwise.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

```javascript
function binarySearch(nums, target) {
  let left = 0;
  let right = nums.length - 1;
  
  while (left <= right) {
    const mid = left + Math.floor((right - left) / 2);
    
    if (nums[mid] === target) {
      return mid;
    }
    
    if (nums[mid] < target) {
      left = mid + 1;
    } else {
      right = mid - 1;
    }
  }
  
  return -1;
}

// Test cases
console.log(binarySearch([-1, 0, 3, 5, 9, 12], 9)); // Output: 4
console.log(binarySearch([-1, 0, 3, 5, 9, 12], 2)); // Output: -1
```
</details>

### Problem 2: Search Insert Position

Given a sorted array and a target value, return the index where the target should be inserted to maintain the sorted order. Assume no duplicates.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

```javascript
function searchInsert(nums, target) {
  let left = 0;
  let right = nums.length - 1;
  
  while (left <= right) {
    const mid = left + Math.floor((right - left) / 2);
    
    if (nums[mid] === target) {
      return mid;
    }
    
    if (nums[mid] < target) {
      left = mid + 1;
    } else {
      right = mid - 1;
    }
  }
  
  return left;
}

// Test cases
console.log(searchInsert([1, 3, 5, 6], 5)); // Output: 2
console.log(searchInsert([1, 3, 5, 6], 2)); // Output: 1
console.log(searchInsert([1, 3, 5, 6], 7)); // Output: 4
```
</details>

### Problem 3: First and Last Position

Given a sorted array of integers that may contain duplicates, find the first and last position of a given target. Return [-1, -1] if the target is not found.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

```javascript
function searchRange(nums, target) {
  const findFirst = () => {
    let left = 0;
    let right = nums.length - 1;
    let result = -1;
    
    while (left <= right) {
      const mid = left + Math.floor((right - left) / 2);
      
      if (nums[mid] >= target) {
        if (nums[mid] === target) {
          result = mid;
        }
        right = mid - 1;
      } else {
        left = mid + 1;
      }
    }
    
    return result;
  };
  
  const findLast = () => {
    let left = 0;
    let right = nums.length - 1;
    let result = -1;
    
    while (left <= right) {
      const mid = left + Math.floor((right - left) / 2);
      
      if (nums[mid] <= target) {
        if (nums[mid] === target) {
          result = mid;
        }
        left = mid + 1;
      } else {
        right = mid - 1;
      }
    }
    
    return result;
  };
  
  return [findFirst(), findLast()];
}

// Test cases
console.log(searchRange([5, 7, 7, 8, 8, 10], 8)); // Output: [3, 4]
console.log(searchRange([5, 7, 7, 8, 8, 10], 6)); // Output: [-1, -1]
```
</details>

### Problem 4: Search in Rotated Sorted Array

Given a rotated sorted array (rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand), search for a target. The array may contain duplicates.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

```javascript
function search(nums, target) {
  let left = 0;
  let right = nums.length - 1;
  
  while (left <= right) {
    const mid = left + Math.floor((right - left) / 2);
    
    if (nums[mid] === target) {
      return mid;
    }
    
    // Handle duplicates
    if (nums[left] === nums[mid] && nums[mid] === nums[right]) {
      left++;
      right--;
      continue;
    }
    
    // Check if left half is sorted
    if (nums[left] <= nums[mid]) {
      // Check if target is in left half
      if (nums[left] <= target && target < nums[mid]) {
        right = mid - 1;
      } else {
        left = mid + 1;
      }
    } 
    // Right half is sorted
    else {
      // Check if target is in right half
      if (nums[mid] < target && target <= nums[right]) {
        left = mid + 1;
      } else {
        right = mid - 1;
      }
    }
  }
  
  return -1;
}

// Test cases
console.log(search([4, 5, 6, 7, 0, 1, 2], 0)); // Output: 4
console.log(search([4, 5, 6, 7, 0, 1, 2], 3)); // Output: -1
```
</details>

### Problem 5: Find Peak Element

A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors. Given an array, find any peak element. You may assume that `nums[-1] = nums[n] = -‚àû`.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

```javascript
function findPeakElement(nums) {
  let left = 0;
  let right = nums.length - 1;
  
  while (left < right) {
    const mid = left + Math.floor((right - left) / 2);
    
    if (nums[mid] > nums[mid + 1]) {
      // Peak is in the left half (including mid)
      right = mid;
    } else {
      // Peak is in the right half
      left = mid + 1;
    }
  }
  
  return left;
}

// Test cases
console.log(findPeakElement([1, 2, 3, 1])); // Output: 2
console.log(findPeakElement([1, 2, 1, 3, 5, 6, 4])); // Output: 5 or 1
```
</details>

## Binary Search Knowledge Check

Test your understanding with these questions:

<details>
<summary>1. What is the time complexity of binary search?</summary>

**Answer**: O(log n) in the average and worst case, O(1) in the best case (when the target is at the middle).
</details>

<details>
<summary>2. Which of these arrays can be searched using binary search?</summary>
- A. [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6]
- B. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
- C. ["apple", "banana", "orange", "pear"]
- D. [true, false, true, false]

**Answer**: B and C can be searched using binary search as they are sorted (C is sorted alphabetically). A is not sorted. D technically has a sort order (false before true) but contains duplicates which might affect finding the correct occurrence.
</details>

<details>
<summary>3. What's the maximum number of comparisons needed to find a value in a sorted array of 1,024 elements using binary search?</summary>

**Answer**: log‚ÇÇ(1024) = 10 comparisons
</details>

<details>
<summary>4. Which of the following is NOT a requirement for binary search?</summary>
- A. The collection must be sorted
- B. The collection must allow random access (constant-time access to any element)
- C. The collection must contain unique elements
- D. The collection must have a defined ordering relation

**Answer**: C. Binary search works fine with duplicates, though you may need a modified version to find the first or last occurrence.
</details>

<details>
<summary>5. What happens if we calculate the middle index in binary search as `(left + right) / 2` instead of `left + (right - left) / 2`?</summary>

**Answer**: In languages that use fixed-size integers like Java or C++, `(left + right)` can cause integer overflow if the sum exceeds the maximum value for that integer type. Using `left + (right - left) / 2` avoids this issue because `(right - left)` will always be within the valid range.
</details>

## Key Takeaways

Throughout this series of lessons, we've covered:

1. **The Core Concept**: Binary search divides the search space in half at each step, achieving O(log n) time complexity.

2. **Implementation Approaches**:
   - Iterative: More memory-efficient with O(1) space complexity
   - Recursive: More elegant but uses O(log n) space due to the call stack

3. **Variations**:
   - Finding first/last occurrences
   - Search insert position
   - Searching in rotated arrays
   - And more!

4. **Common Pitfalls**:
   - Off-by-one errors
   - Integer overflow
   - Infinite loops
   - Not checking array bounds

5. **Optimization Techniques**:
   - Early termination checks
   - Interpolation search for uniform data
   - Hybrid approaches for different array sizes
   - Memory access optimizations

## Beyond Binary Search: Where to Go Next

Now that you've mastered binary search, here are some related topics to explore:

### Advanced Search Algorithms
- **Ternary Search**: Divides the search space into three parts instead of two
- **Exponential Search**: Finds a range where the element is present and then uses binary search
- **Jump Search**: Jumps ahead by fixed steps, then linear searches, balancing between linear and binary search
- **Fibonacci Search**: Similar to binary search but uses Fibonacci numbers to determine search ranges

### Binary Search in Tree Structures
- **Binary Search Trees**: Hierarchical data structures based on binary search principles
- **AVL Trees**: Self-balancing BSTs that maintain O(log n) search time
- **Red-Black Trees**: Another type of self-balancing BST used in many language standard libraries
- **B-trees and B+ trees**: Used extensively in database indexing and file systems

### Related Problem-Solving Patterns
- **Two Pointers Technique**: Often used alongside binary search in array problems
- **Sliding Window**: Efficient way to process subarrays or substrings
