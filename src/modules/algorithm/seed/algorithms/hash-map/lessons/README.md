# Hash Map Algorithm: Step-by-Step Lessons

Welcome to our comprehensive tutorial series on Hash Maps! This series breaks down one of the most important data structures in computer science into easy-to-understand lessons.

## What You'll Learn

In this series, you'll learn:

- Why hash maps are so useful and how they solve key-value storage problems
- How hash functions convert keys into array indices
- Different strategies for handling hash collisions
- How to implement the core operations (put, get, remove)
- Complete hash map implementations with different approaches
- Advanced hash map concepts and practical applications

## Lesson Structure

Each lesson focuses on a specific aspect of hash maps, building your knowledge progressively:

1. [**Understanding the Problem - Key-Value Storage**](./001_problem_description.md) - Introduction to the problem hash maps solve
2. [**Understanding Hash Functions**](./002_hash_functions.md) - The core mechanism that powers hash maps
3. [**Handling Collisions in Hash Maps**](./003_collision_handling.md) - Techniques for resolving hash collisions
4. [**Basic Operations of a Hash Map**](./004_basic_operations.md) - Implementing the fundamental operations
5. [**Building a Complete Hash Map**](./005_implementation.md) - Putting everything together
6. [**Advanced Hash Map Concepts & Applications**](./006_advanced_concepts.md) - Going beyond the basics
7. [**Conclusion - Mastering Hash Maps**](./007_conclusion.md) - Summary and next steps

## How to Use These Lessons

For optimal learning:

1. Study each lesson in order, as concepts build upon previous material
2. Try implementing the code examples yourself
3. Experiment with the algorithms and test them with different inputs
4. Complete the challenges and exercises at the end of each lesson
5. Use the provided visual aids (diagrams, flowcharts) to reinforce your understanding

## Prerequisites

To get the most out of this series, you should have:

- Basic programming knowledge in JavaScript or a similar language
- Understanding of fundamental data structures (arrays, linked lists)
- Familiarity with basic algorithmic concepts
- Curiosity and willingness to experiment!

Happy learning!
