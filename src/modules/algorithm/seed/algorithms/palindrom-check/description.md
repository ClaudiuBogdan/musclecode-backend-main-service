# Palindrome Check

Palindrome Check is a fundamental algorithm that determines whether a string reads the same forward and backward. This elegant algorithm finds applications in various domains, from text processing to computational biology, due to its ability to identify symmetrical patterns.

## The Challenge

Given a string `s`, implement a function to determine if it is a palindrome. A palindrome is a string that reads the same backward as forward, ignoring cases, spaces, and non-alphanumeric characters. The function should return `true` if the string is a palindrome and `false` otherwise.

### Example 1

```js
Input: s = "madam"
Output: true
```

_Explanation: "madam" reads the same backward as forward._

### Example 2

```js
Input: s = "racecar"
Output: true
```

_Explanation: "racecar" reads the same backward as forward._

### Example 3

```js
Input: s = "hello"
Output: false
```

_Explanation: "hello" becomes "olleh" when reversed, which is not the same as the original string._

### Speed and Efficiency
</summary>

The palindrome check algorithm is remarkably efficient:

- **Time Complexity**:
  - **Best/Average/Worst Case:** $O(n)$, where n is the length of the string, as we need to check at most half of the characters.
- **Space Complexity:** 
  - **Two-pointer approach:** $O(1)$ as it requires only a constant amount of extra space.
  - **String reversal approach:** $O(n)$ as it requires creating a reversed copy of the string.

### Key Principles
</summary>

The palindrome check algorithm relies on several core concepts:

- **Symmetry Detection:** Exploits the symmetrical nature of palindromes by comparing characters from both ends.

- **Character Comparison:** Systematically compares corresponding characters from the beginning and end of the string.

- **Preprocessing:** Often involves normalizing the input by removing non-alphanumeric characters and converting to lowercase.

- **Two-Pointer Technique:** Utilizes two pointers moving in opposite directions to efficiently check for palindromic properties.

### Common Pitfalls
</summary>

When implementing a palindrome check, be aware of these common challenges:

- **Case Sensitivity:** Forgetting to normalize letter cases before comparison.

- **Non-alphanumeric Characters:** Failing to handle spaces, punctuation, and special characters.

- **Empty Strings:** Not accounting for edge cases like empty strings (which are technically palindromes).

- **Single-Character Strings:** Overlooking that single-character strings are always palindromes.

- **Unicode Characters:** Challenges with multi-byte characters in some programming languages.

### When and Where to Use Palindrome Check
</summary>

The palindrome check algorithm is particularly useful in:

- **Text Processing:** Identifying palindromic words, phrases, or sentences.

- **Computational Biology:** Finding palindromic sequences in DNA and RNA.

- **Number Theory:** Checking if numbers read the same forward and backward.

- **Puzzle Games:** Creating word puzzles and challenges.

- **Data Validation:** Verifying certain types of input patterns.

However, it may not be suitable for:

- **Very Long Strings:** Where more specialized algorithms might be needed.

- **Approximate Palindromes:** Cases where near-palindromes are acceptable.

Several variations of the palindrome check algorithm exist:

- **Recursive Palindrome Check:** Uses recursion to compare characters from both ends.

- **Longest Palindromic Substring:** Finds the longest substring that is a palindrome.

- **Palindromic Substrings Count:** Counts all palindromic substrings within a string.

- **Almost Palindromes:** Identifies strings that can become palindromes by removing one character.

- **Manacher's Algorithm:** An advanced technique for finding all palindromic substrings in linear time.

### Implementation Approaches
</summary>

There are several ways to implement a palindrome check:

- **Two-Pointer Approach:** Initialize pointers at the beginning and end of the string, moving them toward the center while comparing characters.

- **String Reversal:** Reverse the string and compare it with the original.

- **Iterative Character Matching:** Loop through the string, comparing characters from opposite ends.

- **Recursive Method:** Recursively check if the first and last characters match, then check the substring between them.

- **Stack/Deque Based:** Use a data structure to store and compare characters efficiently.

### A Brief Look at History
</summary>

The concept of palindromes dates back to ancient times, with examples found in Latin word squares and Greek poetry. The term "palindrome" itself comes from the Greek words "palin" (again) and "dromos" (way, direction). While the mathematical and computational study of palindromes is more recent, the fascination with words and numbers that read the same in both directions has persisted throughout human history, making the palindrome check algorithm one of the most culturally significant string processing techniques.
