# Inserting Nodes into a Red-Black Tree üå±

> [!NOTE]
> In this lesson, we'll learn how to insert new nodes into a Red-Black Tree while maintaining all its properties.

## Insertion Overview üìã

Inserting a node into a Red-Black Tree involves two main steps:

1. **Standard BST Insertion**: First, insert the node as you would in a regular Binary Search Tree
2. **Fix Red-Black Properties**: Then, fix any violations of the Red-Black properties

> [!TIP]
> We always color a newly inserted node **RED**. Why? Because it's easier to fix violations when adding a red node than a black one (which would immediately violate the Black Depth Property).

## Step 1: Standard BST Insertion üì•

This part is straightforward:

1. Start at the root and traverse down the tree, going left if the new value is smaller, right if it's larger
2. When you reach a null (NIL) position, insert the new node there
3. Color the new node RED
4. Set the parent, left, and right pointers appropriately

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[20 BLACK] --- B[10 BLACK]
    A --- C[30 BLACK]
    B --- D[5 BLACK]
    B --- E[15 BLACK]
    
    style A fill:black,color:white
    style B fill:black,color:white
    style C fill:black,color:white
    style D fill:black,color:white
    style E fill:black,color:white
```

For example, inserting 25 would place it as the left child of 30:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[20 BLACK] --- B[10 BLACK]
    A --- C[30 BLACK]
    B --- D[5 BLACK]
    B --- E[15 BLACK]
    C --- F[25 RED]
    C --- G[" "]
    
    style A fill:black,color:white
    style B fill:black,color:white
    style C fill:black,color:white
    style D fill:black,color:white
    style E fill:black,color:white
    style F fill:red,color:white
    style G fill:white,color:white
```

## Step 2: Fix Red-Black Properties üîß

After insertion, we need to check if any Red-Black properties are violated. There are three main cases to handle, based on the color of the node's "uncle" (the sibling of the node's parent).

> [!WARNING]
> Red-Black Tree insertion can be complex because we need to handle multiple cases. Take your time understanding each case and its solution.

### Case 1: Uncle is RED ‚ù§Ô∏è

When the uncle node is RED, we:
1. Recolor the parent and uncle to BLACK
2. Recolor the grandparent to RED
3. Recursively check the grandparent for violations

<details>
<summary>Case 1 Example</summary>

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[20 BLACK] --- B[10 RED]
    A --- C[30 RED]
    B --- D[5 BLACK]
    B --- E[15 BLACK]
    C --- F[25 RED]
    
    style A fill:black,color:white
    style B fill:red,color:white
    style C fill:red,color:white
    style D fill:black,color:white
    style E fill:black,color:white
    style F fill:red,color:white
```

Here, after inserting 25 (RED), its parent (30) is RED, violating the Red Property. The uncle (10) is also RED.

After applying Case 1:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[20 RED] --- B[10 BLACK]
    A --- C[30 BLACK]
    B --- D[5 BLACK]
    B --- E[15 BLACK]
    C --- F[25 RED]
    
    style A fill:red,color:white
    style B fill:black,color:white
    style C fill:black,color:white
    style D fill:black,color:white
    style E fill:black,color:white
    style F fill:red,color:white
```

Now we need to check if the grandparent (20) causes any violations.

### Case 2: Uncle is BLACK (Triangle Case) üìê

When the uncle is BLACK and the node forms a "triangle" with its parent and grandparent:
1. Rotate the parent in the opposite direction of the node's position
2. This transforms it into Case 3

<details>
<summary>Case 2 Example (Left-Right Triangle)</summary>

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[20 BLACK] --- B[10 RED]
    A --- C[30 BLACK]
    B --- D[" "]
    B --- E[15 RED]
    
    style A fill:black,color:white
    style B fill:red,color:white
    style C fill:black,color:white
    style D fill:white,color:white
    style E fill:red,color:white
```

Here, 15 forms a "triangle" with its parent (10) and grandparent (20).

After left rotation on parent (10):

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[20 BLACK] --- E[15 RED]
    A --- C[30 BLACK]
    E --- B[10 RED]
    
    style A fill:black,color:white
    style B fill:red,color:white
    style C fill:black,color:white
    style E fill:red,color:white
```

Now we've transformed it into Case 3.
</details>

### Case 3: Uncle is BLACK (Line Case) üìè

When the uncle is BLACK and the node forms a "line" with its parent and grandparent:
1. Rotate the grandparent in the opposite direction of the node's position
2. Recolor the (old) parent to BLACK
3. Recolor the (old) grandparent to RED

<details>
<summary>Case 3 Example (Left Line)</summary>

Starting from Case 2's result:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[20 BLACK] --- E[15 RED]
    A --- C[30 BLACK]
    E --- B[10 RED]
    
    style A fill:black,color:white
    style B fill:red,color:white
    style C fill:black,color:white
    style E fill:red,color:white
```

After right rotation on grandparent (20) and recoloring:

```mermaid
graph TD
    E[15 BLACK] --- B[10 RED]
    E --- A[20 RED]
    A --- F[" "]
    A --- C[30 BLACK]
    
    style A fill:red,color:white
    style B fill:red,color:white
    style C fill:black,color:white
    style E fill:black,color:white
    style F fill:white,color:white
```

Now the Red-Black properties are restored.
</details>

## Final Step: Ensure Root is BLACK üè†

After all fixups, we ensure the root is colored BLACK to maintain Property 2.

```
if root.color == RED:
    root.color = BLACK
```

## Time Complexity ‚è±Ô∏è

Insertion in a Red-Black Tree has a time complexity of **O(log n)**, including both the standard BST insertion and the fixup operations.

> [!TIP]
> While the fixup might seem complex, we'll perform at most O(log n) color changes and O(1) rotations during any insertion.

## Think About It ü§î

1. Why do we color new nodes RED instead of BLACK?
2. In what situations would Case 1 (uncle is RED) propagate all the way to the root?
3. How do the rotations in Cases 2 and 3 help maintain the Red-Black properties?

In the next lesson, we'll explore the most challenging operation: deleting nodes from a Red-Black Tree!
