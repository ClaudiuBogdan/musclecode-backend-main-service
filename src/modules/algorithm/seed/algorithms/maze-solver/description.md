# Maze Solver Algorithm

A maze solver algorithm is designed to find a path from the starting point to the end point in a maze. These algorithms navigate through the complex pathways of a maze by systematically exploring possible routes until they discover a valid solution or determine that no solution exists.

## The Challenge

Given a maze represented as a grid where some cells are walls and others are paths, implement an algorithm to find a path from the start position to the end position. The algorithm should return a sequence of moves that leads from start to end, or indicate that no solution exists.

### Example 1

```js
Input: maze = [
  [0, 1, 0, 0, 0],
  [0, 1, 0, 1, 0],
  [0, 0, 0, 1, 0],
  [1, 1, 0, 1, 0],
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
], start = [0, 0], end = [4, 4]
Output: [[0, 0], [0, 2], [1, 2], [2, 2], [2, 0], [3, 0], [4, 0], [4, 1], [4, 2], [4, 3], [4, 4]]
```

_Explanation: The algorithm finds a path from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner, avoiding walls (represented by 1s)._

### Example 2

```js
Input: maze = [
  [0, 1, 0],
  [0, 1, 0],
  [0, 1, 0]
], start = [0, 0], end = [0, 2]
Output: "No solution exists"
```

_Explanation: The wall in the middle blocks all possible paths from start to end._

### Speed and Efficiency
</summary>

The efficiency of maze solving algorithms varies based on the specific approach:

- **Depth-First Search (DFS)**:
  - **Time Complexity**: O(V + E) where V is the number of cells and E is the number of possible moves
  - **Space Complexity**: O(V) for the recursion stack in the worst case
  
- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**:
  - **Time Complexity**: O(V + E)
  - **Space Complexity**: O(V) for the queue of cells to visit
  
- **A* Algorithm**:
  - **Time Complexity**: O(E) in the worst case, but typically much faster due to heuristics
  - **Space Complexity**: O(V) for storing nodes to visit

- **Wall Follower**:
  - **Time Complexity**: O(V + E)
  - **Space Complexity**: O(1) if implemented iteratively

### Key Principles
</summary>

Maze solving algorithms operate on several fundamental principles:

- **Graph Representation**: Mazes can be represented as graphs where paths are edges and junctions are nodes.

- **Exploration Strategy**: Different algorithms use different strategies to explore the maze:
  - Depth-first approaches go as far as possible along one path before backtracking
  - Breadth-first approaches explore all possible directions at each step
  - Heuristic approaches use additional information to guide the search

- **Path Tracking**: Algorithms must keep track of visited cells to avoid cycles and infinite loops.

- **Termination Conditions**: The search stops when either the destination is reached or all possible paths have been explored.

- **Backtracking**: When a dead end is reached, the algorithm must be able to return to previous decision points and try alternative routes.

### Common Pitfalls
</summary>

When implementing maze solving algorithms, watch out for these common issues:

- **Infinite Loops**: Failing to properly track visited cells can lead to endless cycles.

- **Stack Overflow**: Recursive implementations of DFS may cause stack overflow on large mazes.

- **Memory Constraints**: BFS can consume significant memory for large mazes due to its queue.

- **Inefficient Path Finding**: Some algorithms may find a solution but not the shortest path.

- **Edge Cases**: Special consideration is needed for mazes with no solution, multiple solutions, or when start/end points are the same.

- **Wall Representation**: Inconsistent representation of walls and paths can lead to algorithm failures.

### When and Where to Use Maze Solver Algorithms
</summary>

Different maze solving algorithms are suitable for different scenarios:

- **Depth-First Search**: Ideal for memory-constrained environments and when any solution (not necessarily the shortest) is acceptable.

- **Breadth-First Search**: Best when the shortest path is required and memory is not a constraint.

- **A* Algorithm**: Excellent for large mazes where efficiency is critical and a heuristic can guide the search.

- **Wall Follower**: Works well for simple mazes where the start and end are connected to the outer boundary.

- **Trémaux's Algorithm**: Designed for a human physically navigating a maze without a global view.

- **Recursive Algorithm**: Suitable for small mazes where simplicity of implementation is valued over efficiency.

Several variations of maze solving algorithms exist:

- **Bidirectional Search**: Searches simultaneously from both start and end points.

- **Dijkstra's Algorithm**: Finds the shortest path by assigning weights to movements.

- **Shortest Paths Finder**: Identifies all possible solutions to find the optimal one.

- **Randomized Algorithms**: Introduces randomness to escape local optima in complex mazes.

### A Brief Look at History
</summary>

Maze solving algorithms have a rich history dating back to ancient times. The earliest documented maze-solving technique was the "thread method" inspired by the Greek myth of Theseus and the Minotaur, where Theseus used a thread to mark his path through the Labyrinth.

In the modern era, Trémaux's algorithm was developed in the 19th century as a method for humans to solve mazes by marking visited paths. With the advent of computers, more sophisticated algorithms emerged, including depth-first and breadth-first search in the mid-20th century.

The development of A* in 1968 by Peter Hart, Nils Nilsson, and Bertram Raphael marked a significant advancement, introducing heuristic-guided search that dramatically improved efficiency. Today, maze-solving algorithms continue to evolve, finding applications in robotics, artificial intelligence, and network routing.

### Pseudocode Implementation
</summary>

Here's a pseudocode implementation of a recursive depth-first search maze solver:

```
function solveMaze(maze, startX, startY, endX, endY):
    // Initialize arrays to track visited cells and the correct path
    wasHere = new boolean[width][height] (all false)
    correctPath = new boolean[width][height] (all false)
    
    // Call recursive function to solve the maze
    success = recursiveSolve(startX, startY, endX, endY)
    
    if success:
        return correctPath  // Solution found
    else:
        return "No solution exists"

function recursiveSolve(x, y, endX, endY):
    // Base case: reached the end
    if x == endX and y == endY:
        correctPath[x][y] = true
        return true
    
    // If out of bounds, hit a wall, or already visited
    if x < 0 or y < 0 or x >= width or y >= height or maze[x][y] == 1 or wasHere[x][y]:
        return false
    
    // Mark as visited
    wasHere[x][y] = true
    
    // Try going in all four directions
    if recursiveSolve(x - 1, y, endX, endY):  // Left
        correctPath[x][y] = true
        return true
    if recursiveSolve(x, y - 1, endX, endY):  // Up
        correctPath[x][y] = true
        return true
    if recursiveSolve(x + 1, y, endX, endY):  // Right
        correctPath[x][y] = true
        return true
    if recursiveSolve(x, y + 1, endX, endY):  // Down
        correctPath[x][y] = true
        return true
    
    // No solution found from this cell
    return false
```

### Proof of Correctness
</summary>

The correctness of the recursive depth-first search maze solver can be proven through the following reasoning:

1. **Completeness**: The algorithm systematically explores all possible paths from the starting point by recursively trying all four directions (up, down, left, right) at each cell.

2. **Avoidance of Cycles**: By marking visited cells in the `wasHere` array, the algorithm ensures that it never revisits a cell, preventing infinite loops.

3. **Termination**: The algorithm is guaranteed to terminate because:
   - The maze has a finite number of cells
   - Each cell is visited at most once
   - Each recursive call either finds a solution or backtracks

4. **Correctness of Solution**: When the algorithm finds a path:
   - It correctly identifies when the end point is reached
   - It marks the path in the `correctPath` array only if that path leads to the solution
   - The backtracking ensures that only cells that are part of the solution are marked

5. **Correctness of No Solution Case**: If no solution exists:
   - All possible paths will be explored and rejected
   - The function will return false, correctly indicating that no path exists

6. **Invariant Maintenance**: Throughout execution, the algorithm maintains the invariant that all cells marked in `correctPath` are part of a valid solution from the start to the current position.

This proof demonstrates that the recursive maze solver will always:
- Find a path if one exists
- Correctly report when no path exists
- Return a valid path from start to end when a solution is found
