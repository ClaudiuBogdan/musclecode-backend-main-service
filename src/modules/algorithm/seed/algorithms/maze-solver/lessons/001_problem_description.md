# 🧩 The Maze Solver Problem

> [!NOTE]
> A maze solver algorithm finds a path from the starting point to the end point in a maze, navigating through complex pathways by systematically exploring possible routes.

## 🔍 What is a Maze?

In computer science, a maze is typically represented as a grid (a 2D array) where:
- **0** represents a path (cells we can move through)
- **1** represents a wall (cells we cannot move through)

The maze might look something like this:

```
⬜⬛⬜⬜⬜
⬜⬛⬜⬛⬜
⬜⬜⬜⬛⬜
⬛⬛⬜⬛⬜
⬜⬜⬜⬜⬜
```

Where ⬛ represents walls (1's) and ⬜ represents paths (0's).

## 🎯 The Challenge

Given such a maze, our task is to find a valid path from a designated starting point to an ending point. The algorithm should:

1. Begin at the start position
2. Navigate through the maze, moving only on valid path cells (0's)
3. Reach the end position
4. Return the sequence of moves that forms the path, or indicate that no solution exists

## 🚶‍♂️ Valid Movements

In most maze problems, we can move in four directions:
- Up (decrease row)
- Down (increase row)
- Left (decrease column)
- Right (increase column)

> [!TIP]
> Think of the maze as a coordinate system where [0,0] is the top-left cell, and [rows-1, columns-1] is the bottom-right cell.

## 💡 Example

Here's a simple example of a maze with a solution:

```
Maze:
[0, 1, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 1, 0, 1, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 1, 0]
[1, 1, 0, 1, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
```

Start: [0, 0] (top-left)
End: [4, 4] (bottom-right)

A possible solution path might be:
`[0,0] → [0,2] → [1,2] → [2,2] → [2,0] → [3,0] → [4,0] → [4,1] → [4,2] → [4,3] → [4,4]`

## 🤔 Key Questions to Consider

As you think about this problem, ask yourself:

1. How can we systematically explore the maze?
2. How do we avoid getting stuck in loops or revisiting the same cell?
3. How do we determine if no solution exists?
4. What's the most efficient way to find a path (or the shortest path)?

In the next lessons, we'll explore different approaches to solving this problem, starting with a conceptual understanding and moving to specific algorithms.
