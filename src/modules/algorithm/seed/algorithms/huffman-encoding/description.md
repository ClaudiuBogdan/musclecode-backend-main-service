# Huffman Encoding

Huffman Encoding is a lossless data compression algorithm that uses variable-length codes to represent symbols, with shorter codes assigned to more frequent symbols. This greedy algorithm, developed by David A. Huffman in 1952, creates an optimal prefix code that minimizes the expected length of encoded data.

## The Challenge

Given a set of symbols and their frequencies (or probabilities) of occurrence, develop a method for encoding these symbols that minimizes the overall length of the encoded message. The encoding should ensure that no code is a prefix of another code, making it uniquely decodable.

### Example 1

```js
Input: characters = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f'], frequencies = [5, 2, 1, 1, 2, 4]
Output: {'f': '0', 'c': '100', 'd': '101', 'a': '1100', 'b': '1101', 'e': '111'}
```

_Explanation: Characters with higher frequencies ('a' and 'f') get shorter codes._

### Example 2

```js
Input: characters = ['a', 'b', 'r', 'c', 'd'], frequencies = [5, 2, 2, 1, 1]
Output: {'a': '0', 'r': '10', 'b': '111', 'c': '1100', 'd': '1101'}
```

_Explanation: The string "abracadabra" would be encoded as "01011000101110100"._

### Speed and Efficiency
</summary>

Huffman Encoding balances compression efficiency with computational cost:

- **Time Complexity**:
  - **Building the Huffman Tree:** O(n log n) where n is the number of unique symbols, due to the sorting and heap operations[^4].
  - **Encoding:** O(n) for a message of length n once the tree is built.
  - **Decoding:** O(n) for a message of length n.
- **Space Complexity:** O(n) for storing the Huffman tree and code table.

### Key Principles
</summary>

Huffman Encoding relies on several fundamental concepts:

- **Variable-Length Coding:** Assigns different bit lengths to different symbols based on their frequency.

- **Prefix Property:** No code is a prefix of another code, ensuring unique decodability.

- **Greedy Approach:** At each step, combines the two nodes with the lowest frequencies.

- **Binary Tree Representation:** Uses a binary tree where leaf nodes represent symbols and their paths from the root represent their codes.

- **Frequency-Based Optimization:** Assigns shorter codes to more frequent symbols, reducing overall message length.

### Common Pitfalls
</summary>

When implementing or using Huffman Encoding, be mindful of these common challenges:

- **Overhead for Small Data:** For very small amounts of data, the overhead of storing the Huffman tree might outweigh the compression benefits.

- **Handling Singleton Alphabets:** Special handling is needed when there's only one unique symbol.

- **Dynamic Data:** Standard Huffman coding isn't optimal for data whose symbol frequencies change over time.

- **Frequency Calculation:** Inaccurate frequency estimates can lead to suboptimal compression.

- **Tree Representation:** Inefficient tree representation can consume excessive memory.

### When and Where to Use Huffman Encoding
</summary>

Huffman Encoding is ideal in scenarios such as:

- Text compression where character frequencies vary significantly.

- Image compression formats like JPEG (as part of the compression pipeline).

- File compression utilities like ZIP and GZIP.

- Situations where lossless compression is required.

- Data with highly skewed frequency distributions.

However, it may not be the best choice for:

- Data with uniform frequency distribution (all symbols equally likely).

- Very small datasets where the overhead of storing the tree is significant.

- Applications requiring fixed-length codes for random access.

- Streaming data where the frequency distribution isn't known in advance.

Huffman Encoding is widely used in practical applications:

- **File Compression:** Used in compression utilities like ZIP and GZIP.

- **Image Compression:** Part of the JPEG and PNG compression algorithms.

- **Text Compression:** Used in various text compression tools.

- **Data Transmission:** Reduces bandwidth requirements for network communications.

- **Morse Code:** While not exactly Huffman coding, Morse code follows similar principles by assigning shorter codes to more frequent letters.

- **MP3 Compression:** Used as part of the MPEG audio compression standard.

### Variations and Related Methods
</summary>

Several specialized algorithms extend or modify Huffman Encoding:

- **Adaptive Huffman Coding:** Updates the Huffman tree dynamically as data is processed.

- **Canonical Huffman Coding:** Generates codes in a specific order to simplify decoding.

- **Arithmetic Coding:** Achieves better compression by encoding entire messages as a single number.

- **Shannon-Fano Coding:** A precursor to Huffman coding that also creates variable-length codes.

- **Huffman Coding with Unequal Letter Costs:** Extends the algorithm for situations where different bits have different costs.

### A Brief Look at History
</summary>

Huffman coding was developed by David A. Huffman in 1952 while he was a Ph.D. student at MIT. Interestingly, it came about as a result of a term paper assignment in an information theory class taught by Robert M. Fano[^1]. Fano himself had been working with Claude Shannon on a similar code (Shannon-Fano coding), but Huffman's bottom-up approach proved to be more efficient. Huffman's algorithm has since become a fundamental technique in data compression and information theory, influencing numerous compression methods developed in subsequent decades.

### Pseudocode Implementation
</summary>

```
function buildHuffmanTree(symbols, frequencies):
    // Create a leaf node for each symbol and add it to the priority queue
    priorityQueue = new MinHeap()
    for i from 0 to length(symbols) - 1:
        priorityQueue.add(new Node(symbols[i], frequencies[i]))
    
    // While there is more than one node in the queue
    while priorityQueue.size() > 1:
        // Remove the two nodes of highest priority (lowest frequency)
        left = priorityQueue.extractMin()
        right = priorityQueue.extractMin()
        
        // Create a new internal node with these two nodes as children
        // and with frequency equal to the sum of the two nodes' frequencies
        internalNode = new Node(NULL, left.frequency + right.frequency)
        internalNode.left = left
        internalNode.right = right
        
        // Add this node to the priority queue
        priorityQueue.add(internalNode)
    
    // The remaining node is the root node and the tree is complete
    return priorityQueue.extractMin()

function generateCodes(root, currentCode, huffmanCodes):
    // Base case: leaf node
    if root is a leaf node:
        huffmanCodes[root.symbol] = currentCode
        return
    
    // Recursive case: internal node
    // Traverse left with '0' appended to code
    generateCodes(root.left, currentCode + "0", huffmanCodes)
    
    // Traverse right with '1' appended to code
    generateCodes(root.right, currentCode + "1", huffmanCodes)
    
    return huffmanCodes

function huffmanEncoding(symbols, frequencies):
    root = buildHuffmanTree(symbols, frequencies)
    huffmanCodes = {}
    generateCodes(root, "", huffmanCodes)
    return huffmanCodes
```

### Proof of Correctness
</summary>

The correctness of Huffman coding can be proven through the following logical steps:

1. **Optimality:** Huffman coding produces an optimal prefix code, meaning no other prefix code produces a smaller expected codeword length.

2. **Prefix Property:** The algorithm constructs a binary tree where symbols are only at leaf nodes. This ensures that no code is a prefix of another, as each symbol's code corresponds to a unique path from root to leaf.

3. **Greedy Choice Property:** At each step, combining the two nodes with lowest frequencies is optimal because:
   - The two least frequent symbols will have the longest codewords
   - These two symbols will have codewords of the same length, differing only in the last bit
   - Any other pairing would result in a higher expected codeword length

4. **Induction Step:** If we have an optimal tree for n-1 symbols, adding the nth symbol by combining the two least frequent nodes maintains optimality.

5. **Termination:** The algorithm always terminates after n-1 combinations for n symbols, resulting in a complete binary tree.

6. **Unique Decodability:** Since no code is a prefix of another (prefix property), any encoded message can be uniquely decoded by traversing the Huffman tree from the root.

This proof demonstrates that Huffman coding will always:
- Produce an optimal prefix code for the given frequency distribution
- Generate uniquely decodable codes
- Minimize the expected length of encoded messages

### Algorithm Steps
</summary>

1. **Calculate Frequencies:** Determine the frequency of each symbol in the input data.

2. **Build Min Heap:** Create a min heap (priority queue) where each node contains a symbol and its frequency.

3. **Build Huffman Tree:**
   - Extract the two nodes with the lowest frequencies from the min heap.
   - Create a new internal node with these two nodes as children and with frequency equal to the sum of the two nodes' frequencies.
   - Add this new node back to the min heap.
   - Repeat until only one node remains in the heap (the root of the Huffman tree).

4. **Generate Codes:**
   - Traverse the Huffman tree from the root to each leaf.
   - Assign '0' when moving to the left child and '1' when moving to the right child.
   - The code for each symbol is the sequence of 0s and 1s on the path from root to the leaf containing that symbol.

5. **Encode Data:**
   - Replace each symbol in the original data with its corresponding Huffman code.

6. **Decode Data (when needed):**
   - Start at the root of the Huffman tree.
   - For each bit in the encoded data, move left for '0' and right for '1'.
   - When a leaf node is reached, output its symbol and return to the root.
