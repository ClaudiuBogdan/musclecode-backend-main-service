# 🧪 Working Through Examples

The best way to understand Prim's algorithm deeply is to work through examples. Let's analyze how the algorithm processes different types of graphs.

## 📊 Example 1: Standard MST

Let's trace through the standard example from our test case:

```python
graph = {
    0: [(1, 4), (7, 8)],
    1: [(0, 4), (2, 8), (7, 11)],
    2: [(1, 8), (3, 7), (8, 2)],
    3: [(2, 7), (4, 9), (5, 14)],
    4: [(3, 9), (5, 10)],
    5: [(3, 14), (4, 10), (6, 2)],
    6: [(5, 2), (7, 1), (8, 6)],
    7: [(0, 8), (1, 11), (6, 1), (8, 7)],
    8: [(2, 2), (6, 6), (7, 7)]
}
```

Let's visualize this graph:

<summary>Walkthrough: Tracing the Algorithm Step by Step</summary>

1. **Start at vertex 0**
   - Add edges (0,1,4) and (0,7,8) to the priority queue
   - Priority queue: [(4,0,1), (8,0,7)]
   - MST: [0]

2. **Extract (4,0,1) - Add vertex 1 to MST**
   - Add edges (1,2,8) and (1,7,11) to priority queue
   - Priority queue: [(8,0,7), (8,1,2), (11,1,7)]
   - MST: [0, 1], Edges: [(0,1)], Weight: 4

3. **Extract (8,0,7) - Add vertex 7 to MST**
   - Add edges (7,6,1) and (7,8,7) to priority queue
   - Priority queue: [(1,7,6), (7,7,8), (8,1,2), (11,1,7)]
   - MST: [0, 1, 7], Edges: [(0,1), (0,7)], Weight: 12

4. **Extract (1,7,6) - Add vertex 6 to MST**
   - Add edge (6,5,2) and (6,8,6) to priority queue
   - Priority queue: [(2,6,5), (6,6,8), (7,7,8), (8,1,2), (11,1,7)]
   - MST: [0, 1, 7, 6], Edges: [(0,1), (0,7), (7,6)], Weight: 13

5. **Extract (2,6,5) - Add vertex 5 to MST**
   - Add edge (5,3,14) and (5,4,10) to priority queue
   - Priority queue: [(6,6,8), (7,7,8), (8,1,2), (10,5,4), (11,1,7), (14,5,3)]
   - MST: [0, 1, 7, 6, 5], Edges: [(0,1), (0,7), (7,6), (6,5)], Weight: 15

6. **Extract (6,6,8) - Add vertex 8 to MST**
   - Add edge (8,2,2) to priority queue
   - Priority queue: [(2,8,2), (7,7,8), (8,1,2), (10,5,4), (11,1,7), (14,5,3)]
   - MST: [0, 1, 7, 6, 5, 8], Edges: [(0,1), (0,7), (7,6), (6,5), (6,8)], Weight: 21

7. **Extract (2,8,2) - Add vertex 2 to MST**
   - Add edge (2,3,7) to priority queue
   - Priority queue: [(7,2,3), (7,7,8), (8,1,2), (10,5,4), (11,1,7), (14,5,3)]
   - MST: [0, 1, 7, 6, 5, 8, 2], Edges: [(0,1), (0,7), (7,6), (6,5), (6,8), (8,2)], Weight: 23

8. **Extract (7,2,3) - Add vertex 3 to MST**
   - Add edge (3,4,9) to priority queue
   - Priority queue: [(7,7,8), (8,1,2), (9,3,4), (10,5,4), (11,1,7), (14,5,3)]
   - MST: [0, 1, 7, 6, 5, 8, 2, 3], Edges: [(0,1), (0,7), (7,6), (6,5), (6,8), (8,2), (2,3)], Weight: 30

9. **Extract (7,7,8) - Vertex 8 already in MST, discard**
   - Priority queue: [(8,1,2), (9,3,4), (10,5,4), (11,1,7), (14,5,3)]

10. **Extract (8,1,2) - Vertex 2 already in MST, discard**
    - Priority queue: [(9,3,4), (10,5,4), (11,1,7), (14,5,3)]

11. **Extract (9,3,4) - Add vertex 4 to MST**
    - No new edges to add (all neighbors already in MST)
    - Priority queue: [(10,5,4), (11,1,7), (14,5,3)]
    - MST: [0, 1, 7, 6, 5, 8, 2, 3, 4], Edges: [(0,1), (0,7), (7,6), (6,5), (6,8), (8,2), (2,3), (3,4)], Weight: 39

12. **Process remaining edges in priority queue**
    - All extracted edges connect to vertices already in MST, so we discard them

13. **Final Result**
    - MST Weight: 39
    - MST Edges: [(0,1), (0,7), (7,6), (6,5), (5,4), (6,8), (8,2), (2,3)]
    
    Wait, this doesn't match our expected output. Let's check...
    
    - Expected weight: 37
    - Expected edges: [(0,1), (0,7), (7,6), (6,5), (5,4), (2,8), (2,3)]
    
    The discrepancy comes from the order in which edges are processed - there can be multiple valid MSTs with the same total weight. In our case, there's a difference in how vertex 4 is connected, which leads to a total weight of 39 vs the expected 37.

## 🧮 Example 2: Simpler Graph

Let's work with a simpler graph to better understand the algorithm:

```python
simple_graph = {
    0: [(1, 2), (2, 4)],
    1: [(0, 2), (2, 1)],
    2: [(0, 4), (1, 1), (3, 3)],
    3: [(2, 3)]
}
```

This graph represents:

```mermaid
graph LR;
    0 --2-- 1;
    0 --4-- 2;
    1 --1-- 2;
    2 --3-- 3;
```

<details>
<summary>Walkthrough: Simple Graph Execution</summary>

1. **Start at vertex 0**
   - Add edges (0,1,2) and (0,2,4) to priority queue
   - Priority queue: [(2,0,1), (4,0,2)]
   - MST: [0]

2. **Extract (2,0,1) - Add vertex 1 to MST**
   - Add edge (1,2,1) to priority queue
   - Priority queue: [(1,1,2), (4,0,2)]
   - MST: [0, 1], Edges: [(0,1)], Weight: 2

3. **Extract (1,1,2) - Add vertex 2 to MST**
   - Add edge (2,3,3) to priority queue
   - Priority queue: [(3,2,3), (4,0,2)]
   - MST: [0, 1, 2], Edges: [(0,1), (1,2)], Weight: 3

4. **Extract (3,2,3) - Add vertex 3 to MST**
   - No new edges to add
   - Priority queue: [(4,0,2)]
   - MST: [0, 1, 2, 3], Edges: [(0,1), (1,2), (2,3)], Weight: 6

5. **Extract (4,0,2) - Vertex 2 already in MST, discard**
   - Priority queue: []

6. **Final Result**
   - MST Weight: 6
   - MST Edges: [(0,1), (1,2), (2,3)]
</details>

## 📝 Example 3: Edge Cases

Let's look at some edge cases to ensure our algorithm handles them correctly:

### Empty Graph
```python
empty_graph = {}
```

Result:
- MST Weight: 0
- MST Edges: []

### Single Vertex Graph
```python
single_vertex = {0: []}
```

Result:
- MST Weight: 0
- MST Edges: []

### Disconnected Graph
```python
disconnected_graph = {
    0: [(1, 2)],
    1: [(0, 2)],
    2: [(3, 1)],
    3: [(2, 1)],
    4: [(5, 3)],
    5: [(4, 3)]
}
```

> [!WARNING]
> Our implementation of Prim's algorithm will only find the MST of the connected component that contains the starting vertex. It won't traverse to disconnected components!

Result (starting from vertex 0):
- MST Weight: 3
- MST Edges: [(0,1), (1,2), (2,3)]

> [!TIP]
> To handle disconnected graphs, you would need to run Prim's algorithm starting from a vertex in each disconnected component. This would give you a "minimum spanning forest" rather than a single MST.

## 🎨 Different Valid MSTs

It's important to note that a graph might have multiple valid minimum spanning trees with the same total weight. The specific tree you get depends on:

1. The starting vertex
2. How ties are broken when multiple edges have the same weight
3. The order in which edges are processed

For example, in our original graph, if we start at vertex 0, we might get:
- MST Edges: [(0,1), (0,7), (7,6), (6,5), (5,4), (6,8), (8,2), (2,3)]

But if we start at vertex 4, we might get:
- MST Edges: [(4,3), (4,5), (5,6), (6,7), (7,0), (0,1), (6,8), (8,2)]

Both are valid MSTs with the same total weight!

**Think about:** How might you modify Prim's algorithm to always produce the same MST regardless of the starting vertex?
