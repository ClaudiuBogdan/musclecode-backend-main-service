    Performs a Breadth-First Search (BFS) on a graph represented by an adjacency matrix.

    Args:
        graph: The adjacency matrix representing the graph.
               `graph[i][j] == 1` if there's an edge from vertex i to vertex j, 0 otherwise.
        start_vertex: The index of the starting vertex for the traversal.

    Returns:
        A list containing the indices of the vertices in the order they were visited.
