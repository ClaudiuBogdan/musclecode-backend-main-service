package topologicalsort

// TopologicalSort performs a topological sort on a directed acyclic graph (DAG).
// It returns a valid topological ordering of the vertices, or an empty slice if the graph contains a cycle.
// n: The number of vertices in the graph.
// edges: A list of directed edges, where each edge is represented as a pair of integers [u, v],
// indicating a directed edge from vertex u to vertex v.
func TopologicalSort(n int, edges [][]int) []int {
	// TODO: Implement the topological sort algorithm
	return []int{}
