    Given a directed acyclic graph (DAG), implement a function that returns a linear
    ordering of vertices such that for every directed edge (u, v), vertex u comes before vertex v
    in the ordering.

    Args:
        n: The number of vertices in the graph.
        edges: The edges of the graph represented as a list of [u, v] pairs,
               where u is the starting vertex and v is the ending vertex.

    Returns:
        A topological ordering of the vertices, or an empty list if the graph
        contains a cycle.
