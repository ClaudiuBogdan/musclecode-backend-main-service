 * @param {number[][]} edges - The edges of the graph represented as an array of [u, v] pairs,
 *                              where u is the starting vertex and v is the ending vertex.
 * @returns {number[]} A topological ordering of the vertices, or an empty array if the graph
 *                      contains a cycle.
