title: Implementing Queues with Linked Lists

# üîó Linked List-Based Queue Structure

A linked list implementation uses nodes that reference each other:

```js
class Node {
  constructor(data) {
    this.data = data;
    this.next = null;
  }
}

class Queue {
  constructor(capacity = Infinity) {
    this.front = null; // Points to first node
    this.rear = null; // Points to last node
    this.count = 0;
    this.capacity = capacity;
  }
}
```

> [!info]
> With linked lists, we can easily create unbounded queues by setting capacity to `Infinity`.

## üñºÔ∏è Visual Representation

A linked list queue with elements looks like:

```mermaid
graph LR
    F[Front] --> A[Node: 10] --> B[Node: 20] --> C[Node: 30]
    R[Rear] --> C
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Implementing Core Operations

### Enqueue Operation

```js
enqueue(item) {
  if (this.count >= this.capacity) {
    throw new Error('Queue Overflow');
  }

  const newNode = new Node(item);

  if (this.isEmpty()) {
    // If queue is empty, both front and rear point to new node
    this.front = newNode;
    this.rear = newNode;
  } else {
    // Add to the end and update rear
    this.rear.next = newNode;
    this.rear = newNode;
  }

  this.count++;
}
```

### Dequeue Operation

```js
dequeue() {
  if (this.isEmpty()) {
    return undefined;
  }

  const item = this.front.data;
  this.front = this.front.next;
  this.count--;

  // If queue becomes empty, update rear as well
  if (this.isEmpty()) {
    this.rear = null;
  }

  return item;
}
```

### Peek Operation

```js
peek() {
  if (this.isEmpty()) {
    return undefined;
  }
  return this.front.data;
}
```

## üéØ Tracing Operations

Let's trace through operations on a linked list queue:

1. **Initial state**: `front = null, rear = null, count = 0`
2. **enqueue(10)**:
   - Create new node with data 10
   - `front` and `rear` both point to this node
   - `count = 1`
3. **enqueue(20)**:
   - Create new node with data 20
   - Connect from rear node: `rear.next = newNode`
   - Update `rear` to this new node
   - `count = 2`
4. **dequeue()**:
   - Return the data from `front` (10)
   - Update `front` to `front.next` (the node with 20)
   - `count = 1`

## üîç Key Edge Cases

1. **Empty Queue**: Both `front` and `rear` are `null`
2. **Single Element**: `front` and `rear` point to the same node
3. **Removing the Last Element**: Must set `rear = null` when queue becomes empty

## üí° Advantages and Challenges

**Advantages:**

- Dynamic size (can grow as needed)
- Memory efficient (only allocates what's needed)
- No need for circular logic
- Easy to implement

**Challenges:**

- Extra memory overhead for node pointers
- No direct access to elements in the middle
- Potentially worse cache performance due to non-contiguous memory

  "hint": "Think about what happens to both pointers when the queue becomes empty.",
  "explanation": "When dequeuing the last element, the queue becomes empty. While front naturally becomes null, we must also explicitly set rear to null to properly represent an empty queue.",
  "answer": "Setting rear to null"
}

In the next lesson, we'll compare these implementations to understand their tradeoffs.
