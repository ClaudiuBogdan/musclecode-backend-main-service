# 🧩 Queue: A First-In-First-Out Data Structure

> [!NOTE]
> A Queue is a fundamental data structure that follows the **First-In-First-Out (FIFO)** principle, similar to a line of people waiting for a service.

## 📝 Problem Statement

Imagine you're at a busy ticket counter, and people are lining up to buy tickets. The first person who joins the line gets served first, followed by the second person, and so on. This real-world scenario perfectly illustrates what a queue data structure does in computing.

Your challenge is to implement a queue that can:
- Add elements to the back of the line (**enqueue**)
- Remove elements from the front of the line (**dequeue**)
- View the front element without removing it (**peek**)
- Check if the queue is empty or full

## 🎯 Why Queues Matter

Queues are essential in many computing scenarios:

- 💻 **Process Scheduling**: Operating systems use queues to manage which processes get CPU time
- 🌐 **Web Servers**: Managing incoming requests in order
- 🖨️ **Print Spooling**: Managing document printing jobs
- 🔄 **Breadth-First Search**: Exploring nodes level by level in graph algorithms
- 📱 **Keyboard Buffer**: Managing keystrokes in the order they were pressed

## 🤔 Think About It

Before we dive into the implementation details, consider:

1. How would you implement a queue using:
   - An array?
   - A linked list?
   
2. What are the advantages and disadvantages of each approach?

3. Can you imagine real-world scenarios where you might need a queue?

<summary>💡 Quick Hint</summary>

Think of a queue as a pipe where items enter from one end and exit from the other. The crucial property is that the first item to enter will be the first one to exit.
