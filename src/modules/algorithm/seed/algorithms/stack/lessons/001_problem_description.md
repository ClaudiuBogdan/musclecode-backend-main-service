title: Understanding the Stack Problem

# 🧩 What is a Stack?

> [!NOTE]
> A stack is a linear data structure that follows the **Last In First Out (LIFO)** principle, which means the last element inserted is the first one to be removed.

Think of a stack like a pile of plates in a cafeteria 🍽️. You can only add or remove plates from the top of the pile. The last plate you put on top is the first one you'll take off when you need a plate.

## 🤔 The Problem We're Solving

When working with data, we sometimes need to process items in a specific order - exactly the reverse of the order in which we received them. This is where stacks come into play!

**Our challenge is to implement a stack data structure that provides these core operations:**

- `push(value)`: Add an element to the top of the stack
- `pop()`: Remove and return the element at the top of the stack
- `peek()` (or `top()`): Return the top element without removing it
- `isEmpty()`: Check if the stack is empty

## 🌟 Real-World Examples

Stacks are everywhere in our daily lives and in computing:

- 📚 A stack of books on your desk
- 🥞 A stack of pancakes (you eat from the top!)
- ⏪ The "undo" function in text editors
- 🔙 The "back" button in your web browser
- 📱 Function calls in programming languages

<summary>Why LIFO Matters 🔍</summary>

The LIFO property makes stacks perfect for:
- Tracking state that needs to be unwound in reverse order
- Processing nested structures
- Implementing backtracking algorithms
- Reversing the order of elements

This fundamental property is what makes stacks so useful in solving certain types of problems!

## 💡 Key Insight

> [!TIP]
> Think of a stack as having only one entrance/exit - the **top**. This constraint is actually its superpower!

This simple constraint enables elegant solutions to problems that require tracking history or processing things in reverse order.

## 🤓 Reflection Question

How might the LIFO property of a stack be useful in a real-world scenario you've encountered? Think about processes where the order of "undoing" matters.
