# Job Sequencing with Deadlines

Job Sequencing with Deadlines is a greedy algorithm that selects jobs to maximize profit while ensuring each job is completed before its deadline. This algorithm is particularly useful in scheduling scenarios where each job takes a single unit of time to complete and has an associated profit and deadline.

## The Challenge

Given a set of jobs, each with a profit and a deadline, find the sequence of jobs that maximizes the total profit, ensuring that each selected job can be completed before its deadline. Each job requires exactly one unit of time for execution, and only one job can be executed at a time.

### Example 1

```js
Input: Jobs = [{id: 'J1', profit: 85, deadline: 5}, 
               {id: 'J2', profit: 25, deadline: 4}, 
               {id: 'J3', profit: 16, deadline: 3},
               {id: 'J4', profit: 40, deadline: 3}]
Output: ['J1', 'J4', 'J3']
```

_Explanation: Executing jobs J1, J4, and J3 in appropriate time slots yields the maximum profit of 141._

### Example 2

```js
Input: Jobs = [{id: 'a', profit: 100, deadline: 2}, 
               {id: 'b', profit: 20, deadline: 2}, 
               {id: 'c', profit: 40, deadline: 1},
               {id: 'd', profit: 35, deadline: 3}]
Output: ['c', 'a', 'd']
```

_Explanation: This sequence gives a maximum profit of 175 while meeting all deadlines._

### Speed and Efficiency
</summary>

The Job Sequencing algorithm balances efficiency with optimal results:

- **Time Complexity**:
  - **Sorting Jobs**: O(n log n) to sort jobs by profit in descending order.
  - **Slot Assignment**: O(n²) in the worst case when we search for available slots.
  - **Overall**: O(n²) dominated by the slot assignment phase.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) for storing the result sequence and tracking allocated slots.

With an optimized implementation using a disjoint set data structure, the time complexity can be improved to O(n log n).

### Key Principles
</summary>

The Job Sequencing algorithm operates on several core principles:

- **Greedy Choice Property**: Always selects the job with the highest profit first.

- **Deadline Constraints**: Ensures each job is scheduled before its deadline.

- **Time Slot Allocation**: Assigns each job to the latest possible time slot before its deadline.

- **Single Unit Time**: Assumes each job takes exactly one unit of time to complete.

- **Non-preemptive Scheduling**: Once a job starts, it runs to completion without interruption.

### Common Pitfalls
</summary>

When implementing the Job Sequencing algorithm, watch out for these common issues:

- **Incorrect Sorting**: Failing to sort jobs by profit in descending order.

- **Deadline Misinterpretation**: Confusing 0-indexed vs. 1-indexed time slots.

- **Slot Assignment Logic**: Not searching for the latest available slot before a deadline.

- **Edge Cases**: Not handling jobs with identical deadlines properly.

- **Inefficient Slot Search**: Using linear search instead of more efficient data structures for finding available slots.

### When and Where to Use Job Sequencing
</summary>

Job Sequencing is particularly effective in scenarios such as:

- **CPU Scheduling**: When tasks have different priorities and deadlines.

- **Project Management**: Selecting projects with deadlines to maximize return.

- **Manufacturing Planning**: Scheduling production jobs to maximize profit.

- **Resource Allocation**: When resources are limited and tasks have different values.

However, it may not be suitable for:

- **Scenarios with variable execution times**: When jobs take different amounts of time to complete.

- **Preemptive scheduling requirements**: When jobs can be interrupted and resumed.

- **Complex dependency relationships**: When jobs have prerequisites or dependencies.

The Job Sequencing algorithm finds practical use in various domains:

- **Operating Systems**: For deadline-based task scheduling in real-time systems.

- **Cloud Computing**: Allocating resources to maximize service provider profit.

- **Production Scheduling**: In manufacturing to maximize throughput while meeting delivery deadlines.

- **Event Management**: Scheduling events with different priorities and time constraints.

- **Workforce Management**: Assigning tasks to workers to maximize productivity.

Several variations and related algorithms extend the basic Job Sequencing approach:

- **Job Sequencing with Variable Time**: Adapts the algorithm for jobs with different execution times.

- **Profit Scheduling with Penalties**: Incorporates penalties for missing deadlines.

- **Interval Scheduling**: Focuses on maximizing the number of jobs completed rather than profit.

- **Weighted Activity Selection**: Similar problem with different constraints and objectives.

- **Disjoint Set Optimization**: Uses union-find data structure to improve time complexity.

### A Brief Look at History
</summary>

The Job Sequencing with Deadlines problem is a classic example of the application of greedy algorithms in computer science. It was formalized in the early days of algorithm design and analysis, becoming a standard problem in the study of optimization techniques. The algorithm demonstrates how locally optimal choices can lead to a globally optimal solution in certain problem domains, making it a fundamental concept in algorithm design courses and textbooks.

### Pseudocode Implementation
</summary>

```
function jobSequencing(jobs, n):
    // Sort jobs in decreasing order of profit
    sort jobs in non-increasing order of profit
    
    // Find the maximum deadline
    maxDeadline = maximum deadline among all jobs
    
    // Initialize result array and slot status
    result = array of size maxDeadline initialized with empty values
    slot = array of size maxDeadline initialized with false
    
    // Assign jobs to slots
    for i = 0 to n-1:
        // Find a free slot for current job
        // Start from the last possible slot
        for j = min(maxDeadline, jobs[i].deadline) - 1 down to 0:
            // If slot is empty
            if slot[j] is false:
                result[j] = jobs[i]
                slot[j] = true
                break
    
    // Return scheduled jobs
    return all non-empty jobs in result
```

### Proof of Correctness
</summary>

The correctness of the Job Sequencing algorithm can be established through these logical steps:

1. **Greedy Choice Property**: The algorithm always selects the job with the highest profit first. This is optimal because:
   - If a job with higher profit can be scheduled without displacing other jobs, it should be included
   - If it displaces another job, the total profit increases

2. **Optimal Substructure**: After scheduling a job, the remaining problem is a smaller instance of the original problem.

3. **Feasibility Maintenance**: The algorithm ensures that no two jobs are assigned to the same time slot, and each job is completed before its deadline by:
   - Assigning each job to exactly one time slot
   - Only assigning a job to a slot that is before or equal to its deadline
   - Never overwriting an already assigned slot

4. **Maximality**: The algorithm produces a maximal solution because:
   - Jobs are considered in decreasing order of profit
   - Each job is assigned to the latest possible slot before its deadline
   - This ensures maximum flexibility for scheduling remaining jobs

5. **Termination**: The algorithm terminates after considering all jobs exactly once.

This proof demonstrates that the Job Sequencing algorithm will always produce a sequence of jobs that:
- Maximizes the total profit
- Ensures each selected job is completed before its deadline
- Maintains the constraint that only one job can be executed at a time
