# üìã Job Sequencing with Deadlines

## What is Job Sequencing? ü§î

> [!NOTE]
> Job Sequencing with Deadlines is a **greedy algorithm** that helps us maximize profit by selecting and scheduling jobs optimally, while ensuring each job is completed before its deadline.

Imagine you're a freelancer with multiple projects offered to you. Each project:
- Takes exactly **one day** to complete
- Has a specific **deadline** by which it must be finished
- Offers a certain amount of **profit**

You can only work on one project per day. How do you decide which projects to take to earn the maximum profit while meeting all deadlines?

This is the essence of the Job Sequencing with Deadlines problem.

## Problem Statement üìù

Given a set of jobs, each with:
- A unique identifier (ID)
- A specific profit value
- A deadline (the latest day by which the job must be completed)

Your task is to find a sequence of jobs that maximizes the total profit, ensuring that each selected job can be completed before its deadline.

**Constraints:**
- Each job requires exactly one unit of time (e.g., one day) for execution
- Only one job can be executed at a time
- Each job must be completed on or before its deadline
- Jobs can be scheduled in any order as long as deadlines are met

## Simple Example üí°

Let's consider a small example to understand the problem better:

```
Jobs:
- Job A: Profit = $50, Deadline = Day 2
- Job B: Profit = $40, Deadline = Day 1
- Job C: Profit = $30, Deadline = Day 1
- Job D: Profit = $20, Deadline = Day 3
```

What's the maximum profit we can achieve here?

The optimal sequence would be:
1. Day 1: Job B (profit $40)
2. Day 2: Job A (profit $50)
3. Day 3: Job D (profit $20)

Total profit: $110

We couldn't include Job C because both available slots before its deadline (Days 1 and 2) were filled with higher-profit jobs.

## Why This Problem Matters üåü

Job Sequencing is not just an academic exercise. It has practical applications in:

- **Operating Systems**: CPU scheduling
- **Project Management**: Maximizing returns on limited resources
- **Manufacturing**: Production scheduling to maximize profits
- **Cloud Computing**: Resource allocation

> [!TIP]
> When approaching Job Sequencing problems, always remember that the key challenge is balancing the profit-seeking aspect with the deadline constraints.

In the next lesson, we'll explore the fundamental concepts behind job scheduling that will help us solve this problem effectively.

## Reflection Question ‚ú®

Before moving on, consider this: What do you think would be a good first approach to solve this problem? Would you focus first on deadlines or profits?
