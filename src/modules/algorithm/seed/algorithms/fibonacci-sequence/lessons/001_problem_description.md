# 🔍 The Fibonacci Sequence Problem

> [!NOTE]
> The Fibonacci sequence is one of the most famous and elegant mathematical patterns found in nature and has numerous applications in computer science.

## What is the Fibonacci Sequence? 🤔

The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1.

```
0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, ...
```

Let's break down how the sequence builds:
- We start with 0 and 1
- Then, 0 + 1 = 1
- Next, 1 + 1 = 2
- Then, 1 + 2 = 3
- And 2 + 3 = 5
- And so on...

## 📝 Our Challenge

Given a number `n`, we need to generate the first `n` numbers of the Fibonacci sequence.

### Examples:

> [!TIP]
> Working through examples is a great way to understand an algorithm!

**Example 1:**
```
Input: n = 7
Output: [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8]
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: n = 10
Output: [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34]
```

## 🌟 Why is it important?

The Fibonacci sequence appears in:
- Nature (flower petals, spiral patterns in shells)
- Art and architecture (the golden ratio)
- Financial analysis
- Computer algorithms

<summary>Did you know?</summary>

The sequence is named after Leonardo of Pisa (also known as Fibonacci), who introduced it to Western mathematics in his 1202 book "Liber Abaci," although it was already known in Indian mathematics.

## 🧠 Think About...

Before we dive into the solution, consider:
1. How would you approach generating this sequence?
2. What are the base cases (starting points) for the sequence?
3. What mathematical pattern defines each subsequent number?
