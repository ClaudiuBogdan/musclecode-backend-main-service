# Fibonacci Sequence

The Fibonacci sequence is a fundamental mathematical pattern where each number is the sum of the previous two numbers. It represents one of the most elegant examples of recursive algorithms in computer science and appears frequently in nature and various applications.

## The Challenge

Given a number `n`, generate the first `n` numbers of the Fibonacci sequence. The sequence starts with 0 and 1, and each subsequent number is calculated by adding the previous two numbers[^2][^3].

### Example 1

```python
Input: n = 7
Output: [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8]
```

_Explanation: Each number is the sum of the previous two numbers._

### Example 2

```python
Input: n = 10
Output: [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34]
```

_Explanation: The sequence continues following the same pattern._

### Speed and Efficiency
</summary>

The efficiency varies significantly based on the implementation approach:

- **Recursive Implementation**:
  - **Time Complexity:** $O(2^n)$ - Exponential time due to redundant calculations[^1]
  - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$ - Due to the recursion call stack[^1]

- **Dynamic Programming Implementation**:
  - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$ - Linear time as each number is calculated once[^1]
  - **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$ - For storing the computed values[^1]

- **Iterative Implementation**:
  - **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$ - Linear time
  - **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$ - Only requires two variables[^5]

### Key Principles
</summary>

The Fibonacci sequence is built on three fundamental rules:

- **Base Cases:** 
  - F(0) = 0
  - F(1) = 1[^2]

- **Recursive Formula:** F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2) for n > 1[^2]

- **Sequence Properties:**
  - Each number is the sum of the previous two
  - The ratio of consecutive terms approaches the golden ratio (â‰ˆ1.618)[^9]

### Common Implementations
</summary>

Here are the three main approaches to implementing the Fibonacci sequence:

```python
# Iterative Implementation
def fibonacci_iterative(n):
    a, b = 0, 1
    for _ in range(n):
        print(a)
        a, b = b, a + b[^5]
```

```python
# Recursive Implementation with Memoization
def fibonacci_memoized(n, memo={}):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    if n not in memo:
        memo[n] = fibonacci_memoized(n-1) + fibonacci_memoized(n-2)
    return memo[n][^1]
```

The Fibonacci sequence appears in various real-world scenarios:

- **Nature:** Plant growth patterns and spiral formations
- **Architecture:** Design and proportion calculations
- **Financial Markets:** Technical analysis and trading patterns
- **Computer Science:** Algorithm analysis and optimization problems
- **Art:** Composition and aesthetic proportions

### Best Practices and Optimization
</summary>

When implementing the Fibonacci sequence:

- Use memoization or dynamic programming for large values of n
- Consider using iterative implementation for better space efficiency
- Use appropriate data types to handle large numbers
- Consider using BigInteger for extremely large values to prevent overflow[^1]
