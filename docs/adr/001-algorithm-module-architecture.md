# ADR 001: Algorithm Module Architecture

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The algorithm module is a core component of our system that needs to handle algorithm management, execution, and caching efficiently. We need to make several architectural decisions to ensure the module is maintainable, scalable, and follows best practices.

## Decision

We have made the following architectural decisions:

### 1. Module Structure
- Implemented a modular architecture following NestJS best practices
- Separated concerns into controllers, services, repositories, and DTOs
- Used interfaces to define clear contracts between layers

### 2. API Design
- Implemented RESTful endpoints with proper versioning (v1)
- Used OpenAPI/Swagger decorators for automatic API documentation
- Implemented proper validation using class-validator
- Used DTOs for request/response data transformation

### 3. Caching Strategy
- Implemented Redis caching for improved performance
- Set default TTL of 5 minutes for cached data
- Used CacheInterceptor for automatic caching of GET endpoints
- Implemented cache invalidation on write operations

### 4. Authentication & Authorization
- Implemented JWT-based authentication
- Used Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Protected sensitive endpoints with appropriate guards
- Implemented admin-only routes for data modification

### 5. Error Handling
- Implemented global exception filters
- Used proper HTTP status codes
- Provided meaningful error messages
- Added validation pipes for request data

## Consequences

### Positive
- Improved maintainability through clear separation of concerns
- Better performance through caching
- Enhanced security through proper authentication and authorization
- Better developer experience with automatic API documentation
- Improved data validation and error handling

### Negative
- Increased complexity in the codebase
- Additional dependencies (Redis, JWT)
- Need for proper cache invalidation strategies
- Learning curve for new developers

## Technical Details

### Dependencies
- NestJS framework
- Redis for caching
- class-validator for validation
- @nestjs/swagger for API documentation
- JWT for authentication

### Configuration
- Redis TTL: 5 minutes default
- API version: v1
- Authentication: JWT-based
- Authorization: Role-based (admin role required for modifications)

## Notes

- Regular monitoring of cache hit rates should be implemented
- Consider implementing rate limiting for API endpoints
- Keep documentation up to date as the module evolves
- Consider implementing event-based cache invalidation in the future
